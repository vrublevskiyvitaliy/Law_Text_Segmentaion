The Company
This agreement governs the partnership between the Founders, doing business as [[COMPANY NAME]] (the “Company”). The Company will continue perpetually, unless dissolved in accordance with this agreement. The Founders will cause the Company to register its fictitious name in the jurisdiction where it conducts its business, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The Company’s principal office address will be set by a majority of Founders, and initially is: [[ADDRESS]].
The Founders
The following individuals are hereby admitted as partners in the Company (“Founders”)
[[FOUNDER ONE]]
[[CONTACTS]]
[[FOUNDER TWO]]
[[CONTACTS]]
[[FOUNDER N]]
[[CONTACTS]]
The Project
The Founders have created the Company for the sole purpose of [[DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT]] (the "Project").
Initial Capital
Each Founder hereby commits to contribute up to $[[____]] toward Company expenses when called by the Company, as non-refundable capital contributions. The Company must make capital calls of Founders on a pro rata basis.
Additional Capital Contributions
The Founders may make additional capital contributions in the form of cash and prepaid expenses from time to time to fund the Company’s ongoing capital and operating needs. The written consent of all Founders is required for any Founder to make a capital contribution. No Founder may be required to make a capital contribution except pursuant to such mutual written consent.
Expenses and Budgeting
The Founders will budget for Company expenses on a rolling basis. All budgets must be approved by all Founders in writing. Any Founder may pay budgeted expenses on the Company’s behalf, and the Company will reimburse each Founder for properly budgeted expenses paid on the Company’s behalf, within a reasonable time period after the paying Founder submits an expense report supported by receipts.
Ownership of the Company
Each Founder will have an equal ownership interest in the Company. The Founders’ ownership interests need not be represented by a certificate or any other evidence beyond that contained in this agreement. If a Founder requests, the Company will issue a certificate evidencing the Founder’s interest. The certificate must contain a legend noting that the ownership interest is subject to legal and contractual restrictions on transfer.
Tax Matters
The Company will elect to be taxed as a partnership, and will maintain separate capital accounts for each Founder in accordance with applicable US Treasury Regulations. If the Company earns more than de minimis revenues it will retain an accountant or tax advisor to keep its books and prepare all tax returns and filings on its behalf.
The Company will allocate items of income and losses as if the Company were liquidated, its assets sold at their fair market value, and the resulting proceeds (net of liabilities) distributed to the Founders in accordance with this agreement.
The Company will specially allocate income and losses in accordance with applicable US partnership income tax safe harbor provisions to avoid, to the extent permissible, any Founder having a capital account deficit at the end of any tax year.
The Company will allocate any item of nonrecourse deduction to the Founders equally; provided, that any Founder’s partner nonrecourse deductions for any fiscal year or other period will be specially allocated to the Founder who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable. It is intended that the Company be treated as a pass-through entity for tax purposes. Subject to applicable law, the Company will allocate income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits in the same manner as described above and, solely for tax purposes, any items related to contributed property will be allocated taking into account any difference between the Company’s adjusted basis in such property and the property’s fair market value upon contribution. Any elections or decisions relating to such allocations must be made in a manner that reasonably reflects the intent of this agreement.
[[FOUNDER NAME]] will act as the Company’s tax matters partner, and will act as the primary point of contact with any taxing authorities and other third parties with regard to the Company’s financial and tax matters. The tax matters partner may make any tax election with respect to the Company, provided he obtains the prior written consent of a majority of Founders.
Distributions
The Company may (but is not required to) make ordinary distributions to the Founders out of cash received by the Company (excluding new capital contributions or loans), less all accounts payable and reserves against anticipated expenses from time to time as determined by a majority of Founders. All distributions must be made in the following order:
• First, in equal proportion to all Founders who have contributed cash that has not been repaid, until each Founder has been paid out to the extent of such contributions in full;
• Second, to all Founders in equal proportion.
Management and Approval Rights
The Company will be managed by the Founders, and a majority of Founders may take any action on behalf of the Company except where explicitly stated otherwise in this agreement. The unanimous written approval of all Founders is required to:
• incur any debt on the Company’s behalf or employ its credit, other than receivables to trade creditors in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $250 individually and $500 in aggregate;
• initiate any voluntary bankruptcy proceeding;
• liquidate or dissolve the Company, or distribute substantially all of its assets and business;
• enter into any inbound or outbound license, transfer, or other assignment of protectable intellectual property used in the Project, including any patentable inventions, copyrights, trade secrets, or trademark rights (except for inbound end user licenses for software applications in the ordinary course of business);
• approve any contract with a Founder, or an immediate family member or domestic partner of a Founder, or an affiliate of any of the foregoing persons;
• raise any equity capital in any amount from any person;
• admit any partner to the Company; and
• amend this agreement.
Duties to the Company
The Founders must refer to the Company, in writing, all opportunities to participate in a business or activity that is directly competitive with the Project within [[GEOGRAPHIC REGION]], whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, advisor, investor, or partner. The Company will have 15 days to decide whether to pursue any referred opportunity, and to notify the referring Founder of its decision in writing. If the Company elects not to pursue the opportunity, or if it does not notify the referring Founder of its intent in writing within the 15 day period, then the referring Founder will be free to pursue the opportunity independently. If the Company elects to pursue the opportunity, but later abandons it, then the referring Founder will be free to pursue the opportunity independently at such time.
Other than pursuant to the preceding paragraph, to protect the Company’s legitimate business interests, no Founder may participate in any business or activity that is directly competitive with the Project within [geographic region], whether as an employee, consultant, officer, director, advisor, owner, sole proprietor, investor, or partner. The ownership of 1% or less of the securities of any publicly-traded company will not be considered participation in a competitive business or activity. The Founders’ obligations contained in this section (Duties to the Company) will continue with respect to each Founder until the later of the date that is 3 months after (i) he ceases to be a partner of the Company, and (ii) he ceases to provide any services to the Company, whether as a partner, employee, officer, director, or otherwise.
Other than as explicitly provided herein, no Founder will have any duty to the other Founders or to the Company, including any fiduciary duty, and including any duty to refer business opportunities to the Company, or to refrain from engaging in activity that is competitive with that conducted or planned by the Company.
Project-Related Intellectual Property
“Project IP” means:
(a) contributions and inventions, discoveries, creations, developments, improvements, works of authorship and ideas (whether or not protectable under patent, copyright, or other legal theory) of any kind that are conceived, created, developed or reduced to practice by any Founder, alone or with others, while such Founder is a member of, or provides services to, the Company, regardless of whether they are conceived or made during regular working hours or at the Company’s place of work, that are directly or indirectly related to the Project, result from tasks assigned to a Founder by the Company, or are conceived or made with the use of the Company’s resources, facilities or materials; and (b) any and all patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks (whether or not registered), domain names and other intellectual property rights, worldwide, with respect to any of the foregoing.
The term “Project IP” does not include any inventions developed by a Founder entirely on such Founder’s own time, without using any Company equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information, unless the invention related to the Project at the time of the invention’s conception or reduction to practice.
Each Founder hereby irrevocably assigns to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to all Project IP owned by such Founder. Each Founder agrees (i) to assist the Company from time to time with signing and filing any written documents of assignment that are necessary or expedient to evidence such Founder’s irrevocable assignment of Project IP to the Company; and (ii) to assist the Company in applying for, maintaining, and filing any renewals with respect to Project IP anywhere in the world, in each case at the Company’s expense.
Confidentiality
The Founders agree to keep all non-public information with respect to Project IP confidential and not to disclose it to any other party, except (i) to attorneys and advisors who need to know in connection with performing their duties, (ii) to potential business development partners and/or investors approved by the Company in writing, and who are bound by a confidentiality agreement in writing, and (iii) in response to an inquiry from a legal or regulatory authority.
Third-Party Offer to Invest
The written consent of all Founders is required to approve any additional investment in the Company from any party, including a Founder, and to issue any equity securities or rights convertible into the Company’s equity to any party.
Any Founder who receives an offer from any party to invest in the Company will notify the other Founders of the same, and provide each Founder an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the negotiations surrounding the potential investment in the Company. The Founders will use their best efforts to obtain terms that are no less favorable to any Founder than those outlined in the term sheet attached as Exhibit A hereto. The Founders understand that they would likely be required to submit their equity interests in the Company to vesting and other restrictions in such event, to assign all Project IP to the Company, and to submit to other employment-related covenants.
The Founders anticipate that any transaction resulting from such an offer would require that the Company convert to a business entity that provides limited liability to its members, or else to contribute the Company’s assets and liabilities to a newly-formed business entity with limited liability.
Resignation and Removal of Founders
Any Founder may resign from partnership in the Company for any reason or no reason at all by giving written notice to the other Founders. A majority of Founders may remove a Founder from the partnership at any time, for any reason or no reason at all, by giving written notice to such Founder. Upon a Founder’s resignation or removal, the Company will continue and will not dissolve, so long as at least one Founder remains as a member of the Company. The Company will pay out to the resigning or removed Founder his positive capital account balance (if any) within 180 days of resignation, either in cash or with an unsecured note payable within 2 years and bearing interest at 8% per year.
If only one Founder remains a partner of the Company at any time, then the Company shall continue as a sole proprietorship of the remaining Founder until he resigns, without affecting any rights due to any Founder or former Founder under this agreement.
If no Founder remains as a partner of the Company at any point in time, then the Company will dissolve, and this agreement will terminate immediately upon completion of the winding up of the Company and distribution of its assets and liabilities in accordance with this agreement.
Dissolution
If the Founders determine by unanimous consent to dissolve the Company and wind up its affairs, or if the Company dissolves because no Founders remain as partners, then any persons who were Founders immediately prior to the dissolution event will cause the Company to sell all its property (including Project IP) for cash only, and to liquidate in an orderly fashion. All Founders must be afforded a full opportunity to bid on any Project IP in connection with such liquidation process. The Company will distribute any property that remains after paying for the expenses of dissolving and winding up, and repaying all indebtedness owed by the Company, as follows:
• First, in equal proportion to all Founders who have contributed cash that has not been repaid, until each Founder has been paid out to the extent of such contributions in full;
• Second, to all Founders in equal proportion.
Title to any Project IP that is not sold in connection with dissolution and liquidation of the Company must, however, be distributed to all Founders as owners in common.
Dispute Resolution
All disputes arising from or related to this agreement must be submitted for binding arbitration before a single arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration Association as in effect at such time. The location for such arbitration will be New York, New York. The Founders agree that either party may, within 7 days after the filing of a Demand for Arbitration, demand that the parties' dispute first be submitted to a neutral evaluator pursuant to the American Arbitration Association's Early Neutral Evaluation Procedures prior to proceeding with arbitration.
Any resulting arbitration award may be enforced in any court having valid jurisdiction, wherever located. In addition, the Founders hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Manhattanfor the enforcement of any such arbitration award.
