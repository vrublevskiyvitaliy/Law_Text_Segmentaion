By meeting those three requirements, residents will receive an additional $60 every 6 months (following each inspection) added toward their home buyers account.

Failure to handle minor repairs or failure to pass a property inspection nullifies the total amount accumulated up to that point in the resident's Future Homebuyers Account.
