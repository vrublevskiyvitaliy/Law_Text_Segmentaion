Executive acknowledges that the Company encouraged him to consult with an attorney of his choosing, and through this General Release of Claims encourages him to consult with his attorney with respect to possible claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and that he understands that the ADEA is a Federal statute that, among other things, prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in employment and employee benefits and benefit plans. Without limiting the generality of the release provided above, Executive expressly waives any and all claims under ADEA that he may have as of the date hereof. Executive further understands that by signing this General Release of Claims he is in fact waiving, releasing and forever giving up any claim under the ADEA as well as all other laws within the scope of this paragraph 1 that may have existed on or prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph 1 to the contrary, this General Release of Claims shall not apply to (i) any rights to receive any payments pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Employment Agreement, or any accrued but unpaid benefits under any employee benefit plan maintained by the Company (ii) any rights or claims that may arise as a result of events occurring after the date this General Release of Claims is executed, (iii) any indemnification rights Executive may have as a former officer or director of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies, (iv) any claims for benefits under any directors and officers liability policy maintained by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies in accordance with the terms of such policy, (v) any rights as a holder of equity securities of the Company, and (vi) any rights or claims that, by law, may not be waived, including claims for unemployment compensation and workers compensation. Nothing contained in this Agreement prevents you from filing a charge, cooperating with or participating in any investigation or proceeding before any federal or state Fair Employment Practices Agency, including, without limitation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, except that you acknowledge that you will not be able to recover any monetary benefits in connection with any such claim, charge or proceeding. 15 2. Executive represents that he has not filed against the Released Parties any complaints, charges, or lawsuits arising out of his employment, or any other matter arising on or prior to the date of this General Release of Claims, and covenants and agrees that he will never individually or with any person file, or commence the filing of, any charges, lawsuits, complaints or proceedings with any governmental agency, or against the Released Parties with respect to any of the matters released by Executive pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof (a Proceeding); provided, however, Executive shall not have relinquished his right to commence a Proceeding to challenge whether Executive knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights under ADEA 3. Executive hereby acknowledges that the Company has informed him that he has up to twenty-one (21) days to sign this General Release of Claims and he may knowingly and voluntarily waive that twenty-one (21) day period by signing this General Release of Claims earlier. Executive also understands that he shall have seven (7) days following the date on which he signs this General Release of Claims within which to revoke it by providing a written notice of his revocation to the Company. 4.

The number of 4 Performance Shares to be issued as a pro-rated award under this Section 3.2 shall be determined by multiplying the number of Performance Shares determined under Section 2 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days Recipient was employed by the Company since the beginning of the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the period from the beginning of the Performance Period to the Vesting Date. Any obligation of the Company to issue a pro-rated award under this Section 3.2 shall be subject to and conditioned upon the execution and delivery by Recipient of a Release of Claims in such form as may be requested by the Company. For purposes of this Section 3.2, Cause shall mean (a) the conviction (including a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of Recipient of a felony involving theft or moral turpitude or relating to the business of the Company, other than a felony predicated on Recipients vicarious liability, (b) Recipients continued failure or refusal to perform with reasonable competence and in good faith any of the lawful duties assigned by (or any lawful directions of) the Company that are commensurate with Recipients position with the Company (not resulting from any illness, sickness or physical or mental incapacity), which continues after the Company has given notice thereof (and a reasonable opportunity to cure) to Recipient, (c) deception, fraud, misrepresentation or dishonesty by Recipient in connection with Recipients employment with the Company, (d) any incident materially compromising Recipients reputation or ability to represent the Company with the public, (e) any willful misconduct by Recipient that substantially impairs the Companys business or reputation, or (f) any other willful misconduct by Recipient that is clearly inconsistent with Recipients position or responsibilities. 3.3 Death or Disability If Recipients employment with the Company is terminated at any time prior to the Vesting Date because of death or disability, Recipient shall be entitled to receive a pro-rated award to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable following such event. The term disability means a medically determinable physical or mental condition of Recipient resulting from bodily injury, disease, or mental disorder which is likely to continue for the remainder of Recipients life and which renders Recipient incapable of performing the job assigned to Recipient by the Company or any substantially equivalent replacement job.

The number of Performance Shares to be issued as a pro-rated 5 award under this Section 3.3 shall be determined by multiplying the number of Performance Shares determined after applying the modifications described in the preceding sentences by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days Recipient was employed by the Company since the beginning of the Performance Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the period from the beginning of the Performance Period to the Vesting Date. 3.4 Other Terminations If Recipients employment by the Company is terminated at any time prior to the Vesting Date and neither Section 3.2 nor Section 3.3 applies to such termination, Recipient shall not be entitled to receive any Performance Shares.", "section_full_title": "3.

The Subscriber understands that an investment in the Securities is speculative and involves substantial risks, including the possible loss of the entire investment, and understands the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Subscription Agreement. 6.2Investment Risk; No Operating History. The Subscriber understands that the Company is currently in a development stage and has no operating history nor any history of profitability. The Company reserves the right to obtain additional capital to develop its operations and complete its business plans. There is no assurance that the Company can obtain additional capital to accomplish the foregoing or successfully complete its business plans. As such, the Subscribers investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk which may result in a loss of all or substantially all of the Subscribers investment. 6.3No Review of Fairness. No federal or state agency has passed upon the Securities nor has made any finding, recommendation or determination as to the fairness of this investment. 6.4No Representations Concerning Suitability. The Company has made no representations or recommendations to the Subscriber concerning whether the purchase of the Securities is a suitable investment for it. The Subscriber and its representative, if any, have the sole responsibility for determining whether this investment is suitable for the Subscriber.

The Subscribers investment in the Company is an illiquid investment, and the Subscriber must bear the economic risk of its investment. 5 6.7The Securities Are Not Registered With The SEC Nor With Any State Securities Authorities.The Securities will not be registered under the Act nor under any state securities laws nor the securities laws of any other country in reliance upon specific exemptions from registration under the provisions of the Act and applicable state securities laws and the laws of other countries. The Securities issued will be deemed \"restricted securities\" and may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without an effective registration statement under the Act or an exemption therefrom. As a result, the Securities may be transferred or resold only if the Securities have been registered or there is an available exemption from registration and the certificates representing the Securities will bear a legend to this effect. The Securities are being offered in reliance upon an exemption from the registration provisions of the Act, pursuant to Regulation S promulgated thereunder. 6.8Dilution in Initial Equity Interest. Any further issuance by the Company of any additional Securities of the Company will dilute any equity interest of the Subscriber. No assurances can be given that the Company will not issue additional securities that will have the effect of diluting the equity interest of the Subscriber. 6.9Due Diligence and Investigation. The offer and sale of the Units is not underwritten by or being offered through investment bankers or underwriters. There has not been an independent review of matters covered in the Subscription Agreement by any such professionals or other professionals. Subscriber must rely solely upon its own investigation and analysis of the risks in making this investment decision. 6.10No Established Public Trading Market. Even though the Companys Common Stock is traded over-the-counter by quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol AMNP the Subscriber realizes there is no established public trading market for the Securities. 6.11Penny Stock Regulations Affect the Companys Stock Price, Which May Make it More Difficult to Sell.Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price per share of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The Securities are subject to the penny stock rules, and investors may find it more difficult to sell their securities. 6", "section_full_title": "6.Risk Factors.", "clusterTitleType": "17", "document_id": "14tsEF5dHpm8B2kKm0TbpP.", "section_title": "Risk Factors."}, {"text": " Neither this Subscription Agreement nor any provisions hereof shall be modified, discharged or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any modification, discharge or termination is sought.", "section_full_title": "9.Modification", "clusterTitleType": "17", "document_id": "14tsEF5dHpm8B2kKm0TbpP.", "section_title": "Modification"}, {"text": " Subject to the provisions of this Subscription Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and the Subscriber, on the other hand, will pay all fees and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred by them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder.", "section_full_title": "11.Payment of Expenses", "clusterTitleType": "17", "document_id": "14tsEF5dHpm8B2kKm0TbpP.", "section_title": "Payment of Expenses"}, {"text": " Except as otherwise provided herein, this Subscription Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives and assigns.

(iv)Additional Credits. Prior to settlement in accordance with Section 6(a) hereof, additional Dividend Equivalents will be credited to the Employees Account to the extent Performance Shares in excess of the Target Number are settled so that Employee is credited for Dividend Equivalents on the excess Performance Shares on the same basis they would have been had the excess Performance Shares been credited to Employees Account as of the relevant earlier date. (b)Adjustments. The number of Performance Shares credited to Employees Account shall be appropriately adjusted in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Employees rights with respect to Performance Shares or to reflect any changes in the number of outstanding shares of Stock resulting from any event referred to in Section 11(c) of the Plan, taking into account any Performance Shares credited to Employee in connection with such event under Section 5(a) hereof.

Marketer shall allow CITGO, its agents and contractors access to the retail facility for the purpose of said sampling for testing under CITGOs Quality Assurance Program to ensure that motor fuels marketed by Marketer are in compliance 7 with all federal and state regulations. Marketer shall allow the RFG Survey Association, its agents and contractors, the same access. Marketer shall provide to CITGO a copy of the results of any testing that was performed on the motor fuels by Marketer or that were received by the Marketer from the EPA or its contractors or any other third party. In the event that a violation of the federal or state requirements for gasoline is detected, whether by testing or otherwise, Marketer shall immediately cease selling the non-complying product and take such further action as is necessary to remedy the violation, including such action as CITGO or the EPA may request. Furthermore, Marketer must immediately report any violations to CITGO and advise CITGO of corrective actions, steps to prevent further violations, steps to identify the causes of the violations and the results of resampling and testing. This reporting must be in writing. b. FEDERAL VOLATILITY REGULATIONS AND RFG/ANTI-DUMPING REGULATIONS: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations restricting the maximum allowable reid vapor pressure (RVP) for gasoline (40 CRF Part 80, 80.27). The maximum RVP during the RVP season (generally June 1 through September 15) is 7.8psi in nonattainment areas and 9.0 psi in all other areas. Additionally, various states have promulgated regulations restricting the maximum allowable RVP of gasoline and, in some cases, these regulations mandate the gasoline have an RVP lower than 7.8 psi and for time period that exceed the federal requirement of June 1 through September 15. These regulations provide for the imposition of substantial penalties whenever violations occur. The EPA requires that only RFG may be delivered to retail locations that are located within various ozone nonattainment areas (RFG Areas). While CITGO will supply you with fuels to meet all federal, state and local regulations, it is also your responsibility to comply with the regulations. These regulations prescribe various rule concerning segregation of RFG, product transfer documentation when transferring custody or title through the distribution chain, quality assurance programs, fuel additive requirements, retention of record for five years, varying specification by regions and registration with the EPA. These regulations also provide for the imposition of substantial penalties whenever violations occur. Marketer further agrees to comply with all applicable posting and labeling laws and regulations, including but not limited to those pertaining to octane ratings, lead and oxygenates. c. OXYGENATE BLENDING: Marketer may not blend oxygenates into CITGO gasolines without prior written consent from CITGO. Marketer may request permission for such blending by providing a written request that contains but is not limited to the following information: blending location, blending rate, and description of Marketers quality assurance program: In the event that Marketer elects to blend oxygenates into CITGO gasoline, Marketer shall defend and indemnify CITGO against claims, damages, costs and expenses which arise from or relate to such blending. With respect to RBOB, only CITGO or its designee may blend oxygenate. d.

(b) Distributions on Account of Separation from Service. If and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A, no payment or benefit required to be paid under this Agreement on account of termination of the Executives employment shall be made unless and until the Executive incurs a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A.

Such interest shall be calculated from the date on which the payment otherwise would have been made until the date on which the payment is made.

(d) No Acceleration of Payments. Neither the Company nor the Executive, individually or in combination, may accelerate any payment or benefit that is subject to Section 409A, except in compliance with Section 409A and the provisions of this Agreement, and no amount that is subject to Section 409A shall be paid prior to the earliest date on which it may be paid without violating Section 409A.

For purposes of applying the provisions of Section 409A to this Agreement, each separately identified amount to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In addition, to the extent permissible under Section 409A, any series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. 7 (f) Taxable Reimbursements.

Acceleration Lender may make all or any part of the amount owing by the terms of the Loan immediately due. If Borrower is a debtor in a bankruptcy petition or in an application filed under Section 5(a)(3) of the Securities Investor Protection Act, the Loan is automatically accelerated and immediately due and payable without notice or demand upon filing of the petition or application. B. Sources Lender may use any and all remedies Lender has under state or federal law or in any Loan Document. C. Insurance Benefits Lender may make a claim for any and all insurance benefits or refunds that may be available on Borrowers default. D. Payments Made on Borrowers Behalf Amounts advanced on Borrowers behalf will be immediately due and may be added to the balance owing under the terms of the Loan and accrue interest at the highest post-maturity interest rate. Page 18 E. Termination Lender may terminate Borrowers right to obtain advances under the Loan, and Lender may refuse to make any further extensions of credit to Borrower. F. Set-Off Lender may use the right of set-off. This means Lender may set-off any amount due and payable under the terms of the Loan against any right Borrower has to receive money from Lender. Borrowers right to receive money from Lender includes any deposit or share account balance Borrower has with Lender, any money owed to Borrower on an item presented to Lender or in Lenders possession for collection or exchange, and any repurchase agreement or other non-deposit obligation. Any amount due and payable under the terms of the Loan means the total amount to which Lender is entitled to demand payment under the terms of the Loan at the time Lender set-off. Subject to any other written contract, if Borrowers right to receive money from Lender is also owned by someone who has not agreed to pay the Loan, Lenders right of set-off will apply to Borrowers interest in the obligation and to any other amounts Borrower could withdraw on Borrowers sole request or endorsement. Lenders right of set-off does not apply to an account or other obligation where Borrowers rights arise only in a representative capacity. It also does not apply to any Individual Retirement Account or other tax-deferred retirement account. Lender will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because Lender set-off against any of Borrowers accounts. Borrower agrees to hold Lender harmless from any such claims arising as a result of Lenders exercise of Lenders right of set-off. G. Assembly of Property Lender may require Borrower to assemble the Property and make the Property available to Lender in a reasonable fashion. H. Possession Lender may take possession of the Property so long as such taking of possession does not involve a breach of the peace. Lender may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Property in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Lender may apply what Lender receives from the disposition of the Property to Lenders expenses, Lenders attorneys fees and legal expenses, where not prohibited by law, and to the Secured Debts. If proceeds received by Lender from the disposition of the Property do not satisfy the Secured Debts, Borrower shall remain liable for the deficiency (where permitted by law). In some cases, Lender may keep the Property to satisfy the Secured Debts. Where a notice is required, Borrower agrees that ten days prior written notice sent by first class mail to Borrowers address listed in this Agreement will be reasonable notice to Borrower under the Texas Business and Commerce Code (UCC). If the Property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, Lender may, without notice to Borrower, dispose of any or all of the Property in a commercially reasonable manner at Borrowers expense following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing. If any items not otherwise subject to this Agreement are contained in the Property when Lender takes possession, Lender may hold such items for Borrowers account and Borrowers risk, and Lender will not be liable for taking possession of such items. Page 19 I. Transfer of Patents Lender may exercise the rights to transfer ownership of all or some of the Patents to Lender described in Section 4C(5) of this Agreement. J. Use and Operation Lender may enter upon any premises upon or within which the Property is located and take possession of all or any part of the Property for the purpose of preserving the Property or the Propertys value, so long as Lender does not breach the peace. Lender may use and operate the Property for the length of time Lender feels is necessary to protect Lenders interest, all without payment or compensation to Borrower, or, at Lenders option and without notice to Borrower, Lender may appoint an ex parte receiver for the purposes of preparing or processing items of the Property at Borrowers expense and for the additional purposes of selling and disposing of items of the Property.
