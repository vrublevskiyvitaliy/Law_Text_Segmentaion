For avoidance of doubt, no Warrant shall be exercisable for less than three Ordinary Shares.

No adjustments as to dividends will be made upon exercise of the Warrants. The Warrant Exercise Period shall commence (subject to Section 6(d) below) immediately upon the consummation of the IPO and shall end on the earlier of (x) the fourth anniversary of the date of the final prospectus relating to the IPO and (y) the Business Day preceding the date on which such Warrants are redeemed pursuant to Section 6(b) below. Business Day shall mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or any other day on which banks in the City of New York, New York, are authorized or required by law to close. Each Warrant not exercised or redeemed prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Warrant Exercise Period shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time. (b)Redemption of Warrants 3 The Company may call the Warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant, upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each Warrant holder, at any time after such Warrants have become exercisable pursuant to Section 6(a) above, if, and only if, (A) the Closing Price has equaled or exceeded $23.00 per ADS for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period ending on the third Business Day prior to the notice of redemption to Warrant holders and (B) at all times between the date of such notice of redemption and the redemption date a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act is in effect covering the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those Warrant Shares is available. The Company shall send to the Warrant holders and file with the Warrant Agent a notice of such redemption. Such notice shall be mailed to the registered holders at their addresses as they appear in the warrant register. The Closing Price of the ADSs on any date of determination means: (A) the last reported sale price for the regular trading session (without considering after hours or other trading outside regular trading session hours) of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, (B) if the ADSs are not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, the last reported sale price reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the ADSs are so listed, (C) if the ADSs are not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the ADSs in the over-the-counter market as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board, the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or (D) if the ADSs are not so quoted, the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the ADSs from at least three nationally recognized investment banking firms that the Company selects for this purpose.

Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date of the surrender of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price. The Warrants shall be exercisable, at the election of the holders thereof, either in full or from time to time in part and, in the event that a certificate evidencing Warrants is exercised in respect of fewer than all of the Warrant Shares issuable on such exercise at any time prior to the date of expiration of the Warrants, a new certificate evidencing the remaining Warrant or Warrants will be issued, and the Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to countersign and to deliver the required new Warrant Certificate or Certificates pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof and of this Section 6, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent, shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.

(f)Form of Warrant The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 11, and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Exercise Price and the same number of shares as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

The Subscriber understands that an investment in the Securities is speculative and involves substantial risks, including the possible loss of the entire investment, and understands the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Subscription Agreement. 6.2Investment Risk; No Operating History. The Subscriber understands that the Company is currently in a development stage and has no operating history nor any history of profitability. The Company reserves the right to obtain additional capital to develop its operations and complete its business plans. There is no assurance that the Company can obtain additional capital to accomplish the foregoing or successfully complete its business plans. As such, the Subscribers investment in the Company involves a high degree of risk which may result in a loss of all or substantially all of the Subscribers investment. 6.3No Review of Fairness. No federal or state agency has passed upon the Securities nor has made any finding, recommendation or determination as to the fairness of this investment. 6.4No Representations Concerning Suitability. The Company has made no representations or recommendations to the Subscriber concerning whether the purchase of the Securities is a suitable investment for it. The Subscriber and its representative, if any, have the sole responsibility for determining whether this investment is suitable for the Subscriber. The Company is not responsible to the Subscriber for making any such determination. 6.5Unit Price May Fluctuate. In accordance with the Shares Issuance Agreement, the Unit Price and the exercise price of the Warrants may fluctuate from time to time based upon market conditions and trading activity of the Companys Common Stock. 6.6Illiquid Investment. The Subscribers investment in the Company is an illiquid investment, and the Subscriber must bear the economic risk of its investment. 5 6.7The Securities Are Not Registered With The SEC Nor With Any State Securities Authorities.The Securities will not be registered under the Act nor under any state securities laws nor the securities laws of any other country in reliance upon specific exemptions from registration under the provisions of the Act and applicable state securities laws and the laws of other countries. The Securities issued will be deemed \"restricted securities\" and may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without an effective registration statement under the Act or an exemption therefrom. As a result, the Securities may be transferred or resold only if the Securities have been registered or there is an available exemption from registration and the certificates representing the Securities will bear a legend to this effect. The Securities are being offered in reliance upon an exemption from the registration provisions of the Act, pursuant to Regulation S promulgated thereunder. 6.8Dilution in Initial Equity Interest. Any further issuance by the Company of any additional Securities of the Company will dilute any equity interest of the Subscriber. No assurances can be given that the Company will not issue additional securities that will have the effect of diluting the equity interest of the Subscriber. 6.9Due Diligence and Investigation. The offer and sale of the Units is not underwritten by or being offered through investment bankers or underwriters. There has not been an independent review of matters covered in the Subscription Agreement by any such professionals or other professionals. Subscriber must rely solely upon its own investigation and analysis of the risks in making this investment decision. 6.10No Established Public Trading Market. Even though the Companys Common Stock is traded over-the-counter by quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol AMNP the Subscriber realizes there is no established public trading market for the Securities. 6.11Penny Stock Regulations Affect the Companys Stock Price, Which May Make it More Difficult to Sell.Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated by certain penny stock rules adopted by the SEC. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price per share of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The Securities are subject to the penny stock rules, and investors may find it more difficult to sell their securities. 6", "section_full_title": "6.Risk Factors.", "document_id": "14tsEF5dHpm8B2kKm0TbpP.", "section_title": "Risk Factors."}, {"text": " The Subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and any person, if any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, and the Companys officers, directors, agents, attorneys, and affiliates harmless from and against all damages, losses, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses reasonably incurred in the investigation or preparation in defense of any litigation commenced or threatened or any claim whatsoever, which they may incur by reason of the failure by the Subscriber to comply with the terms and conditions of this Subscription Agreement, or by reason of any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty or covenant made by the Subscriber herein, or in any document provided by the Subscriber to the Company in connection with the Subscribers investment in the Securities.

Company shall increase Executive's annual base salary from its current level of $1,600,000 per year to $1,700,000 per year effective for the next fiscal year ended January 29, 2011 (\"fiscal 2010\"), payable in equal installments in accordance with Company's payroll practices for executive employees. Executive agrees to defer pursuant to Company's Deferred Compensation Plan the amount of base salary for each calendar year that is greater than $1,000,000. The Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the \"Committee\") of the Board will establish Executive's base salary and other compensation for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 by notice to Executive prior to the end of the prior fiscal year, and base salary shall be not less than the amount for the immediately preceding fiscal year. 3.2. Cash Bonus. 3.2.1. Incentive Bonus. Executive will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus targeted at 130% of his base salary with a maximum bonus of 260% of base salary under the Company's 2005 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, as amended (\"the Plan\"). The Plan conditions the payment of this annual performance bonus based on achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Committee. The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms are met prior to payment. It is the parties' intention that the Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes to the maximum extent possible the amount of any annual incentive bonus. The incentive bonus determined to be due, if any, will be paid within 120 calendar days after the close of Company's fiscal year and completion of an outside audit by Company's then current outside audit firm. 3.2.2. Long Term Incentive Cash Plan. Executive is eligible to receive a long term incentive bonus under the Company Long Term Incentive Cash Plan, which has been established under the Plan (the \"LTI Plan\"), for fiscal 2009 and has an account balance for prior years under the LTI Plan (the \"LTI Account\"). Executive will receive payment of: (a) one-half of the amount in the LTI Account on the day in spring 2010 when the other executives of the Company receive their fiscal 2010 payment; and (b) the entire remaining amount in the LTI Account on the day in spring 2011 when the other executives of the Company receive their fiscal 2011 payment. It is the Company's intention that the LTI Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes all amounts paid pursuant to the LTI Plan. 3.3. Long Term Equity Compensation. Executive shall receive long term equity incentive compensation under the Plan for each fiscal year on terms similar to those of other senior executives at the Company as set forth below. 3.3.1. Restricted Stock Unit Awards. The Chairman shall recommend to the Committee that Executive receive three annual grants of restricted stock unit awards during the term of this Agreement, one for each of fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, with each grant made pursuant to and subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. For fiscal 2010 the size of the award shall be equal to the number of shares of Company's common stock equal to $3,990,000 divided by the closing sale price on the grant date. The amount of the award for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 shall be fixed by the Committee. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, each restricted stock unit award will vest and be paid in three equal annual installments. Either the grant or the vesting of the awards will be subject to achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Committee. The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms are met prior to any vesting or payment. It is the parties' intention that the Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables the Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes to the maximum extent possible the value of all restricted stock unit awards. The delivery of restricted stock earned will be made on the business day closest to the anniversary of the grant date as set forth in the award agreement. Any restricted stock unit awards unvested at the time of termination of Executive's employment shall (subject to achievement of any applicable performance goals) continue to vest without pro-ration; provided, however, that if employment is terminated by Executive's disability (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(4)) or death all such awards shall immediately vest in full and shall be paid within 30 days after such disability or death, and; provided, further, if employment is terminated \"for cause,\" all such unvested awards shall lapse . 3.3.2 Long-term Performance Restricted Stock Unit Awards. The Chairman shall recommend to the Committee that Executive receive three annual grants of long-term performance restricted stock unit awards during the term of this Agreement, one for each of fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, with each grant made pursuant to and subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. For fiscal 2010 the size of the award shall be equal to the number of shares of Company's common stock equal to $2,850,000 divided by the closing sale price on the grant date. The amount of the award for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 shall be fixed by the Committee. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Committee will condition the vesting of this restricted stock based on achievement of pre-determined performance goals set forth in writing and based on objective measurements all established by the Committee. The Committee must verify that the performance goals and other material terms are met prior to vesting (as certified by an outside audit by Company's then current outside audit firm for the fiscal year applicable to the respective performance goal). It is the parties' intention that the Plan be adopted and administered in a manner that enables Company to deduct for federal income tax purposes to the maximum extent possible the value of all long-term performance restricted stock unit awards. The delivery of restricted stock earned, if any, will be made within 120 calendar days after the close of Company's fiscal year. Any long-term performance restricted stock unit awards unvested at the time of termination of Executive's employment shall (subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals) continue to vest without pro-ration and shall be paid within 30 days after such vesting; provided, however, if employment is terminated \"for cause,\" all such unvested awards shall lapse. 3.3.3. Stock Options. The Chairman shall recommend to the Committee that Executive receive three grants of stock options during the term of this Agreement, the first for fiscal 2010, the second in fiscal 2011 and the third in fiscal 2012, with each grant made pursuant to and subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Plan. The fiscal 2010 grant shall be made the date this Agreement is executed and shall be for the number of shares of Company's common stock with a grant date value equal to $4,560,000 based on the method used by the Company for computing stock option expense for financial statement purposes and with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date as defined in the Plan. The fiscal 2011 and 2012 grants shall be made on the dates that other executive officers of Company receive their annual stock option grants and shall be for the number of shares of Company's common stock with a grant date value to be determined by the Committee. Each option shall vest and be exercisable as to one third of the amount of the grant on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Any stock options unvested at the time of termination of Executive's employment shall continue to vest without pro-ration; provided, however, that if employment is terminated by Executive's disability (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(4)) or death, all such options shall immediately vest in full and; provided, further, if employment is terminated \"for cause,\" all such unvested options shall lapse. Options will be exercisable until the earlier of (a) seven years from the grant date, or (b) (i) for options that are or become exercisable upon the termination of Executive's employment (including those accelerated on death or disability), for one year after the termination of employment and (ii) for options that are not exercisable upon the termination of Executive's employment, the options shall continue to vest and shall be exercisable for one year after the vesting date when such options first become exercisable. 3.4.

Company will make available charter air and car services to Executive for business purposes and for commuting to and from work.

Any amount included in Executive's W-2 wages relative to the car or commuting expenses shall be not be grossed up for tax purposes. 3.6. Business Expenses. Company shall pay, advance or reimburse Executive for all normal and reasonable business-related expenses incurred by Executive during the term of this Agreement, including travel expenses, incurred in the performance of his duties on the same basis as paid to other senior executives. Company shall furnish Executive with company credit cards provided to other senior executives for use solely in the performance of his duties. The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a taxable year of the Executive shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year. 3.7. Taxes. The compensation provided to Executive hereunder shall be subject to any withholdings and deductions required by any applicable tax laws. 3.8. Benefit Plans. During the term of this Agreement, Executive is entitled to participate in any deferred compensation or other employee benefit plans, including any profit sharing or 401(k) plans; group life, health, hospitalization and disability insurance plans; discount privileges; and other employee welfare benefits made available generally to, and under the same terms as, Company's other executives.", "section_full_title": "3.

Such payments shall be made in the time and manner specified in Section 5.7 of this Agreement. 5.2. Permanent Disability.

Pay Executive the Retirement Benefit in the manner provided under Section 5.7 of this Agreement.

Failure to meet performance targets and measures shall not constitute \"cause\" as that term is used herein. Executive may have an opportunity to be heard by the Board prior to a termination for cause. For purposes of this paragraph, Executive's acts or omissions shall be considered \"willful\" if done without a good faith, reasonable belief that such act or omission was in Company's best interest. In the event of termination for cause, Company shall pay Executive any base salary earned and any rights or benefits that have vested, including any declared but unpaid annual incentive cash bonus, the LTI Account, all deferred compensation, and any vested equity awards but excluding the Retirement Benefit, which shall be forfeited in its entirety as will all unvested equity awards. 5.6. Early Retirement. Executive may terminate this Agreement by electing early retirement at any time by giving at least 60 calendar days' written notice of his intention to retire to Company's Chairman, which Company may accept immediately.

Provided, however, that notwithstanding the forgoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all restricted stock unit awards, long-term performance restricted stock unit awards, and stock option awards that were made or granted within six months prior to Executive's retirement shall terminate and shall never vest or become exercisable. 5.7. Payments Due Upon a Termination Before February 1, 2013. In the event of any termination of Executive's employment under this Agreement prior to February 1, 2013, Executive (or his estate) shall be paid any unpaid portion of his salary that has accrued by virtue of his employment during the period prior to termination, and any unpaid, declared bonus, together with any unpaid business expenses properly incurred under this Agreement prior to termination.

Executive (or his estate) shall also have the right to exercise stock options in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and Executive shall receive payout of the LTI Account, any Severance Payment owed to Executive, and the Retirement Benefit in a lump sum within 30 days of the termination, except as otherwise provided under Section 5.8 of this Agreement. 5.8. Timing of Payments.

If Company suspends any payments, it will aggregate and pay these amounts to Executive on the earliest of (a) the date that is six months and one day after the termination date, (b) the date of the Executive's death, or (c) any earlier date that does not result in such additional tax or interest under Code Section 409A.

By: Name: Title: Vice President 11 EXHIBIT A ANNEXED TO AND INCORPORATED IN DEPOSIT AGREEMENT [FORM OF FACE OF ADR] No. of ADSs: Number Each ADS represents Six Shares CUSIP: AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPT evidencing AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES representing ORDINARY SHARES of DAQO NEW ENERGY CORP. (Incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands) JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America, as depositary hereunder (the Depositary), hereby certifies that is the registered owner (a Holder) of American Depositary Shares (ADSs), each (subject to paragraph (13)) representing six ordinary shares (including the rights to receive Shares described in paragraph (1), Shares and, together with any other securities, cash or property from time to time held by the Depositary in respect or in lieu of deposited Shares, the Deposited Securities), of Daqo New Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the Company), deposited under the Deposit Agreement dated as of [DATE] , 2010 (as amended from time to time, the Deposit Agreement) among the Company, the Depositary and all Holders from time to time of American Depositary Receipts issued thereunder (ADRs), each of whom by accepting an ADR becomes a party thereto. The Deposit Agreement and this ADR (which includes the provisions set forth on the reverse hereof) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. A-1 (1) Issuance of ADRs; Pre-Release. This ADR is one of the ADRs issued under the Deposit Agreement. Subject to paragraph (4), the Depositary may so issue ADRs for delivery at the Transfer Office (defined in paragraph (3)) only against deposit of: (a) Shares in form satisfactory to the Custodian; (b) rights to receive Shares from the Company or any registrar, transfer agent, clearing agent or other entity recording Share ownership or transactions; or, (c) in accordance with the next paragraph of this paragraph (1). In its capacity as Depositary, the Depositary shall not lend Shares or ADSs; provided, however, that the Depositary may issue ADSs prior to the receipt of Shares (each such transaction a Pre-Release). The Depositary may receive ADSs in lieu of Shares to close out a Pre-Release (which ADSs will promptly be canceled by the Depositary upon receipt by the Depositary). Each such Pre-Release will be subject to a written agreement whereby the person or entity (the Applicant) to whom ADSs are to be delivered (a) represents that at the time of the Pre-Release the Applicant or its customer owns the Shares that are to be delivered by the Applicant under such Pre-Release, (b) agrees to indicate the Depositary as owner of such Shares in its records and to hold such Shares in trust for the Depositary until such Shares are delivered to the Depositary or the Custodian, (c) unconditionally guarantees to deliver to the Depositary or the Custodian, as applicable, such Shares, and (d) agrees to any additional restrictions or requirements that the Depositary deems appropriate. Each such Pre-Release will be at all times fully collateralized with cash, U.S. government securities or such other collateral as the Depositary deems appropriate, terminable by the Depositary on not more than five (5) business days notice and subject to such further indemnities and credit regulations as the Depositary deems appropriate. The Depositary will normally limit the number of ADSs involved in such Pre-Release at any one time to thirty percent (30%) of the ADSs outstanding (without giving effect to Pre-Released ADSs outstanding), provided, however, that the Depositary reserves the right to change or disregard such limit from time to time as it deems appropriate. The Depositary may also set limits with respect to the number of ADSs involved in Pre-Release with any one person on a case-by-case basis as it deems appropriate. The Depositary may retain for its own account any compensation received by it in conjunction with the foregoing. Collateral provided as described above, but not the earnings thereon, shall be held for the benefit of the Holders (other than the Applicant). Every person depositing Shares under the Deposit Agreement represents and warrants that such Shares are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid, nonassessable and free of pre-emptive rights, that the person making such deposit is duly authorized so to do and that such Shares (A) are not restricted securities as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (Restricted Securities) unless at the time of deposit the requirements of paragraphs (c), (e), (f) and (h) of Rule 144 shall not apply and such Shares may be freely transferred and may otherwise be offered and sold freely in the United States or (B) have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. To the extent the person depositing Shares is an affiliate of the Company as such term A-2 is defined in Rule 144, the person also represents and warrants that upon the sale of the ADSs, all of the provisions of Rule 144 which enable the Shares to be freely sold (in the form of ADSs) will be fully complied with and, as a result thereof, all of the ADSs issued in respect of such Shares will not be on the sale thereof, Restricted Securities. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of Shares and issuance of ADRs. The Depositary will not knowingly accept for deposit under the Deposit Agreement any Shares required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and not so registered; the Depositary may refuse to accept for such deposit any Shares identified by the Company in order to facilitate the Companys compliance with such Act. (2) Withdrawal of Deposited Securities. Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), upon surrender of (i) a certificated ADR in form satisfactory to the Depositary at the Transfer Office or (ii) proper instructions and documentation in the case of a Direct Registration ADR, the Holder hereof is entitled to delivery at, or to the extent in dematerialized form from, the Custodians office of the Deposited Securities at the time represented by the ADSs evidenced by this ADR. At the request, risk and expense of the Holder hereof, the Depositary may deliver such Deposited Securities at such other place as may have been requested by the Holder. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Deposit Agreement or this ADR, the withdrawal of Deposited Securities may be restricted only for the reasons set forth in General Instruction I.A.(1) of Form F-6 (as such instructions may be amended from time to time) under the Securities Act of 1933. (3) Transfers of ADRs.

Title to this ADR (and to the Deposited Securities represented by the ADSs evidenced hereby), when properly endorsed (in the case of ADRs in certificated form) or upon delivery to the Depositary of proper instruments of transfer, is transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of negotiable instruments under the laws of the State of New York; provided that the Depositary, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, may treat the person in whose name this ADR is registered on the ADR Register as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes and neither the Depositary nor the Company will have any obligation or be subject to any liability under the Deposit Agreement to any holder of an ADR, unless such holder is the Holder thereof. Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), this ADR is transferable on the ADR Register and may be split into other ADRs or combined with other ADRs into one ADR, evidencing the aggregate number of ADSs surrendered for split-up or combination, by the A-3 Holder hereof or by duly authorized attorney upon surrender of this ADR at the Transfer Office properly endorsed (in the case of ADRs in certificated form) or upon delivery to the Depositary of proper instruments of transfer and duly stamped as may be required by applicable law; provided that the Depositary may close the ADR Register at any time or from time to time when deemed expedient by it or when reasonably requested by the Company in order to comply with applicable law. At the request of a Holder, the Depositary shall, for the purpose of substituting a certificated ADR with a Direct Registration ADR, or vice versa, execute and deliver a certificated ADR or a Direct Registration ADR, as the case may be, for any authorized number of ADSs requested, evidencing the same aggregate number of ADSs as those evidenced by the certificated ADR or Direct Registration ADR, as the case may be, substituted.

If any tax or other governmental charge shall become payable by or on behalf of the Custodian or the Depositary with respect to this ADR, any Deposited Securities represented by the ADSs evidenced hereby or any distribution thereon, such tax or other governmental charge shall be paid by the Holder hereof to the Depositary. The Depositary may refuse to effect any registration, registration of transfer, split-up or combination hereof or, subject to the last sentence of paragraph (2), any withdrawal of such Deposited Securities until such payment is made. The Depositary may also deduct from any distributions on or in respect of A-4 Deposited Securities, or may sell by public or private sale for the account of the Holder hereof any part or all of such Deposited Securities (after attempting by reasonable means to notify the Holder hereof prior to such sale), and may apply such deduction or the proceeds of any such sale in payment of such tax or other governmental charge, the Holder hereof remaining liable for any deficiency, and shall reduce the number of ADSs evidenced hereby to reflect any such sales of Shares.

The Depositary will forward to the Company such information from its records as the Company may reasonably request to enable the Company to file any necessary reports with governmental authorities or agencies. If the Depositary determines that any distribution in property other than cash (including Shares or rights) on Deposited Securities is subject to any tax that the Depositary or the Custodian is obligated to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, by public or private sale, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the Holders entitled thereto. Each Holder of an ADR or an interest therein agrees to indemnify the Depositary, the Company, the Custodian and any of their respective directors, employees, agents and affiliates against, and hold each of them harmless from, any claims by any governmental authority with respect to taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest arising out of any refund of taxes, reduced rate of withholding at source or other tax benefit obtained.

There is no guarantee that Holders generally or any Holder in particular will receive the notice described above with sufficient time to enable such Holder to return any voting instructions to the Depositary in a timely manner. (13) Changes Affecting Deposited Securities. Subject to paragraphs (4) and (5), the Depositary may, in its discretion, amend this ADR or distribute additional or amended ADRs (with or without calling this ADR for exchange) or cash, securities or property on the record date set by the Depositary therefor to reflect any change in par value, split-up, consolidation, cancellation or other reclassification of Deposited Securities, any Share Distribution or Other Distribution not distributed to Holders or any cash, securities or property available to the Depositary in respect of Deposited Securities from (and the Depositary is hereby authorized to surrender any Deposited Securities to any person and, irrespective of whether such Deposited Securities are surrendered or otherwise cancelled by operation of law, rule, regulation or otherwise, to sell by public or private sale any property received in connection with) any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company, and to the extent the Depositary does not so amend this ADR or make a distribution to Holders to reflect any of the foregoing, or the net proceeds thereof, whatever cash, securities or property results from any of the foregoing shall constitute Deposited Securities and each ADS evidenced by this ADR shall automatically represent its pro rata interest in the Deposited Securities as then constituted. (14) Exoneration. The Depositary, the Company, their agents and each of them shall: (a) incur no liability (i) if any present or future law, rule, regulation , fiat, order or decree of the United States, the Cayman Islands, The Peoples Republic of China (including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Peoples Republic of China) or any other country, or of any governmental or regulatory authority or any securities exchange or market or automated quotation system, the provisions of or governing any Deposited Securities, any present or future provision of the Companys charter, any act of God, war, terrorism or other circumstance beyond its control shall prevent or delay, or shall cause any of them to be subject to any civil or criminal penalty in connection with, any act which the Deposit Agreement or this ADR provides shall be done or performed by it or them (including, without limitation, voting pursuant to paragraph (12) hereof), or (ii) by reason of any exercise or failure to exercise any discretion given it in the Deposit Agreement or this ADR; (b) assume no liability except to perform its obligations to the extent they are specifically set forth in this ADR and the Deposit Agreement without gross negligence or bad faith; (c) in the case of the Depositary and its agents, be under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Deposited Securities or this ADR; (d) in the case of the Company and its agents hereunder be under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Deposited Securities or this ADR, which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, A-10 unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense (including fees and disbursements of counsel) and liability be furnished as often as may be required; or (e) not be liable for any action or inaction by it in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting Shares for deposit, any Holder, or any other person believed by it to be competent to give such advice or information. The Depositary shall not be liable for the acts or omissions made by any securities depository, clearing agency or settlement system in connection with or arising out of book-entry settlement of Deposited Securities or otherwise, so long as such acts or omissions are not caused as a direct result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary. The Depositary shall not be responsible for, and shall incur no liability in connection with or arising from, the insolvency of any Custodian that is not a branch or affiliate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Depositary, its agents and the Company may rely and shall be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by them to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote any of the Deposited Securities, for the manner in which any such vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote. The Depositary and its agents may own and deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in ADRs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Deposit Agreement or an ADR, the Depositary and its agents may fully respond to any and all demands or requests for information maintained by or on its behalf in connection with the Deposit Agreement, any Holder or Holders, any ADR or ADRs or otherwise related hereto or thereto to the extent such information is requested or required by or pursuant to any lawful authority, including without limitation laws, rules, regulations, administrative or judicial process, banking, securities or other regulators. None of the Depositary, the Custodian or the Company shall be liable for the failure by any Holder or beneficial owner to obtain the benefits of credits on the basis of non-U.S. tax paid against such Holders or beneficial owners income tax liability. The Depositary and the Company shall not incur any liability for any tax consequences that may be incurred by Holders and beneficial owners on account of their ownership of the ADRs or ADSs. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Depositary and its agents under certain circumstances and the Depositary has agreed to indemnify the Company under certain circumstances. Neither the Company nor the Depositary nor any of their agents shall be liable to Holders or beneficial owners of interests in ADSs for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, lost profits) of any form incurred by any person or entity, whether or not foreseeable and regardless of the type of action in which such a claim may be brought. No disclaimer of liability under the Securities Act of 1933 is intended by any provision hereof. (15) Resignation and Removal of Depositary; the Custodian. The Depositary may resign as Depositary by written notice of its election so to do delivered to the Company, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as provided in the Deposit Agreement. The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by no less than 90 days prior written notice of such removal, to become effective upon the later of (i) the 90th day after delivery of the notice to the Depositary and (ii) the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as provided in the A-11 Deposit Agreement. The Depositary may appoint substitute or additional Custodians and the term Custodian refers to each Custodian or all Custodians as the context requires. (16) Amendment. Subject to the last sentence of paragraph (2), the ADRs and the Deposit Agreement may be amended by the Company and the Depositary, provided that any amendment that imposes or increases any fees or charges (other than stock transfer or other taxes and other governmental charges, transfer or registration fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses), or that shall otherwise prejudice any substantial existing right of Holders, shall become effective 30 days after notice of such amendment shall have been given to the Holders. Every Holder of an ADR at the time any amendment to the Deposit Agreement so becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such ADR, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right of the Holder of any ADR to surrender such ADR and receive the Deposited Securities represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law. Any amendments or supplements which (i) are reasonably necessary (as agreed by the Company and the Depositary) in order for (a) the ADSs to be registered on Form F-6 under the Securities Act of 1933 or (b) the ADSs or Shares to be traded solely in electronic book-entry form and (ii) do not in either such case impose or increase any fees or charges to be borne by Holders, shall be deemed not to prejudice any substantial rights of Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any governmental body or regulatory body should adopt new laws, rules or regulations which would require amendment or supplement of the Deposit Agreement or the form of ADR to ensure compliance therewith, the Company and the Depositary may amend or supplement the Deposit Agreement and the ADR at any time in accordance with such changed laws, rules or regulations. Such amendment or supplement to the Deposit Agreement in such circumstances may become effective before a notice of such amendment or supplement is given to Holders or within any other period of time as required for compliance. Notice of any amendment to the Deposit Agreement or form of ADRs shall not need to describe in detail the specific amendments effectuated thereby, and failure to describe the specific amendments in any such notice shall not render such notice invalid, provided, however, that, in each such case, the notice given to the Holders identifies a means for Holders to retrieve or receive the text of such amendment (i.e., upon retrieval from the Commissions, the Depositarys or the Companys website or upon request from the Depositary). (17) Termination. The Depositary may, and shall at the written direction of the Company, terminate the Deposit Agreement and this ADR by mailing notice of such termination to the Holders at least 30 days prior to the date fixed in such notice for such termination; provided, however, if the Depositary shall have (i) resigned as Depositary hereunder, notice of such termination by the Depositary shall not be provided to Holders unless a successor depositary shall not be operating hereunder within 45 days of the date of such resignation, or (ii) been removed as Depositary hereunder, notice of such termination by the Depositary shall not be provided to Holders unless a successor depositary shall not be operating hereunder on the 90th day after the Companys notice of removal was first provided to the Depositary. After the date so fixed for termination, the Depositary and its agents will perform no further acts A-12 under the Deposit Agreement and this ADR, except to receive and hold (or sell) distributions on Deposited Securities and deliver Deposited Securities being withdrawn. As soon as practicable after the expiration of six months from the date so fixed for termination, the Depositary shall sell the Deposited Securities and shall thereafter (as long as it may lawfully do so) hold in a segregated account the net proceeds of such sales, together with any other cash then held by it under the Deposit Agreement, without liability for interest, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of ADRs not theretofore surrendered. After making such sale, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations in respect of the Deposit Agreement and this ADR, except to account for such net proceeds and other cash. After the date so fixed for termination, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations under the Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary and its agents. (18) Appointment. Each Holder and each person holding an interest in ADSs, upon acceptance of any ADSs (or any interest therein) issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement shall be deemed for all purposes to (a) be a party to and bound by the terms of the Deposit Agreement and the applicable ADR(s), and (b) appoint the Depositary its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, to act on its behalf and to take any and all actions contemplated in the Deposit Agreement and the applicable ADR(s), to adopt any and all procedures necessary to comply with applicable law and to take such action as the Depositary in its sole discretion may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Deposit Agreement and the applicable ADR(s), the taking of such actions to be the conclusive determinant of the necessity and appropriateness thereof. (19) Waiver. EACH PARTY TO THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH HOLDER AND BENEFICIAL OWNER AND/OR HOLDER OF INTERESTS IN ADRS) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DEPOSITARY AND/OR THE COMPANY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SHARES OR OTHER DEPOSITED SECURITIES, THE ADSs OR THE ADRs, THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, OR THE BREACH HEREOF OR THEREOF (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, COMMON LAW OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

Each Global Note will represent such of the outstanding Notes as will be specified therein and each shall provide that it represents the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions. Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect the amount of any increase or decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby will be made by the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof as required by Section 2.06 hereof. (c) Execution. At least one Officer must sign the Notes for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that office at the time a Note is authenticated, the Note will nevertheless be valid. A Note will not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee. The signature will be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture. (d) Authentication. The Trustee will, upon receipt of a written order of the Company signed by two Officers (an Authentication Order), authenticate Notes for original issuance in an aggregate principal amount specified in the written order of the Company pursuant to this Section 2.02. Such Authentication Order shall specify the amount of Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the original issue of Notes is to be authenticated. The aggregate principal amount of Notes, including any Additional Notes, of a series outstanding at any time may not exceed the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series authorized for issuance by the Company, pursuant to one or more Authentication Orders, except as provided in Section 2.07 hereof. 8 The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Notes. An authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with Holders or an Affiliate of the Company. Section 2.03 Registrar and Paying Agent The Company will maintain an office or agency where Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (Registrar) and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment (Paying Agent). The Registrar will keep a register of the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term Registrar includes any co-registrar and the term Paying Agent includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar. The Company initially appoints The Depository Trust Company (DTC) to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes. The Company initially appoints the Trustee to act as the Registrar and Paying Agent and to act as Custodian with respect to the Global Notes. Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust The Company will require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal, premium or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, and will notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company) will have no further liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as Paying Agent, it will segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Company, the Trustee will serve as Paying Agent for the Notes. Section 2.05 Holder Lists The Trustee will preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of all Holders of each series of Notes and shall otherwise comply with TIA  312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company will furnish to the Trustee at least seven Business Days before each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of each series of Notes and the Company shall otherwise comply with TIA  312(a). Section 2.06 Transfer and Exchange (a) Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes A Global Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or to another nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Notes of a series will be exchanged by the Company for Definitive Notes of such series if: (1) the Company delivers to the Trustee notice from the Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 120 days after the date of such notice from the Depositary; (2) the Company in its sole discretion determines that the Global Notes (in whole but not in part) of such series should be exchanged for Definitive Notes of such series and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustee; or (3) there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series. Upon the occurrence of either of the events in (1) or (2) above, Definitive Notes of such series shall be issued in such names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may be exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Sections 2.07 and 2.10 hereof. Other than as provided in this Section 2.06(a), every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu 9 of, a Global Note or any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.06 or Section 2.07 or 2.10 hereof, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Note; provided, that beneficial interests in a Global Note may be transferred and exchanged as provided in Section 2.06(b) or (c) hereof. (b) Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in the Global Notes The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Applicable Procedures. Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes also will require compliance with either subparagraph (1) or (2) below, as applicable, as well as one or more of the other following subparagraphs, as applicable: (1) Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global Note. Beneficial interests in any Global Note may be transferred to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in the same Global Note. No written orders or instructions shall be required to be delivered to the Registrar to effect the transfers described in this Section 2.06(b)(1). (2) All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial Interests in Global Notes. In connection with all transfers and exchanges of beneficial interests that are not subject to Section 2.06(b)(1) above, the transferor of such beneficial interest must deliver to the Registrar either: (A) both: (i) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in another Global Note of such series in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged; and (ii) instructions given in accordance with the Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the Participant account to be credited with such increase; or (B) both: (i) a written order from a Participant or an Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance with the Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to cause to be issued a Definitive Note of such series in an amount equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged; and (ii) instructions given by the Depositary to the Registrar containing information regarding the Person in whose name such Definitive Note of such series shall be registered to effect the transfer or exchange referred to in Section 2.06(b)(2)(B)(i) above. Upon satisfaction of all of the requirements for transfer or exchange of beneficial interests in Global Notes contained in this Indenture and the Notes or otherwise applicable under the Securities Act, the Trustee shall adjust the principal amount of the relevant Global Note(s) pursuant to Section 2.06(g) hereof. (c) Transfer or Exchange of Beneficial Interests in Global Notes for Definitive Notes If any holder of a beneficial interest in an Global Note of a series proposes to exchange such beneficial interest for a Definitive Note of such series or to transfer such beneficial interest to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a Definitive Note of such series, then, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 2.06(b)(2) hereof, the Trustee shall cause the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Global Note of such series to be reduced accordingly pursuant to Section 2.06(g) hereof, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Person designated in the instructions a Definitive Note of such series in the appropriate principal amount. Any Definitive Note issued in exchange for a beneficial interest pursuant to this Section 2.06(c) shall be registered in such name or names and in such authorized denomination or denominations as the holder of such beneficial interest requests through instructions to the Registrar from or through the Depositary and the Participant or Indirect Participant. The Trustee shall deliver such Definitive Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are so registered. (d) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes for Beneficial Interests in Global Notes A Holder of a Definitive Note of a series may exchange such Note for a beneficial interest in a Global Note of such series or transfer such Definitive Notes to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in a Global Note of such series at any time. Upon receipt of a request for such an exchange or transfer, the Trustee will cancel the applicable Definitive Note and increase or cause to be increased the aggregate principal amount of one of the Global Notes of such series pursuant to Section 2.06(g) hereof. (e) Transfer and Exchange of Definitive Notes for Definitive Notes Upon request by a Holder of Definitive Notes and such Holders compliance with the provisions of this Section 2.06(e), the Registrar will register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Notes. Prior to such registration of transfer or exchange, the requesting Holder must present or surrender to the Registrar the Definitive Notes of such series duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by such Holder or by its attorney, duly authorized in writing. A Holder of Definitive Notes of a series may transfer 10 such Notes to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form of a Definitive Note of such series. Upon receipt of a request to register such a transfer, the Registrar shall register the Definitive Notes of such series pursuant to the instructions from the Holder thereof, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Person designated in the instructions a Definitive Note of such series in the appropriate principal amount. (f) Global Note Legend Each Global Note issued under this Indenture, unless specifically stated otherwise in the applicable provisions of this Indenture, will bear a legend in substantially the following form: THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS HELD BY THE DEPOSITARY (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THIS NOTE) OR ITS NOMINEE IN CUSTODY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS HEREOF, AND IS NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY PERSON UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPT THAT (1) THE TRUSTEE MAY MAKE SUCH NOTATIONS HEREON AS MAY BE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.06 OF THE INDENTURE, (2) THIS GLOBAL NOTE MAY BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE BUT NOT IN PART PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.06(a) OF THE INDENTURE, (3) THIS GLOBAL NOTE MAY BE DELIVERED TO THE TRUSTEE FOR CANCELLATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.11 OF THE INDENTURE AND (4) THIS GLOBAL NOTE MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE COMPANY. UNLESS AND UNTIL IT IS EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR NOTES IN DEFINITIVE FORM, THIS NOTE MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY. UNLESS THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (55 WATER STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK) (DTC) TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY GLOBAL NOTE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS MAY BE REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS MAY BE REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN. (g) Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes At such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note of a series have been exchanged for Definitive Notes of such series or a particular Global Note has been redeemed, repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note will be returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 2.11 hereof. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Note of a series is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note of such series or for Definitive Notes of such series, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note will be reduced accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note of such series, such other Global Note will be increased accordingly and an endorsement will be made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to reflect such increase. (h) General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges (1) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof or at the Registrars request. (2) No service charge will be made to a Holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.07 and 9.05 hereof or other provisions relating to any offer to purchase Notes required to be made by the Company contained in any Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers Certificate establishing or amending a series of Notes). (3) The Registrar will not be required to register the transfer of or exchange of any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. 11 (4) All Global Notes and Definitive Notes of a series issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes of such series will be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive Notes of such series surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. (5) Neither the Registrar nor the Company will be required: (A) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any Notes of a series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of any selection of Notes of such series for redemption under Section 3. (B) to register the transfer of or to exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part; or (C) to register the transfer of or to exchange a Note of a series between a record date and the next succeeding interest payment date of such series. (6) Prior to due presentment for the registration of a transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Company may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such Note and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Company shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (7) The Trustee will authenticate Global Notes and Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 hereof. (8) All certifications and certificates required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06 to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile. Section 2.07 Replacement Notes If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or each of the Company and the Trustee receives evidence to its respective satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Company will issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate a replacement Note of the same series if the Trustees requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, an indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee and the Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Company may charge a Holder for the Companys expenses in replacing a Note. Every replacement Note of a series is an additional obligation of the Company and will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes of such series duly issued hereunder. Section 2.08 Outstanding Notes The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof or in any provision of the form of Note that so expressly states, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Note. If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser. If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue. If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes will be deemed to be no longer outstanding and will cease to accrue interest. Section 2.09 Treasury Notes In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes of a series have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Affiliate of the Company, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. 12 Section 2.10 Temporary Notes Until certificated Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes will be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Company will prepare and the Trustee will authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Holders of temporary Notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture. Section 2.11 Cancellation The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else will cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will dispose of such canceled Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act) in its customary manner. The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a series of Notes, it will pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment. The Company will fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date; provided that no such special record date may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) will mail or cause to be mailed to Holders of such series of Notes a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid. Section 2.13 CUSIP Numbers The Company in issuing the Notes may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT Section 3.01 Optional Redemption Notes of any series that are redeemable before their maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms set forth in any Board Resolution, Officers Certificate or supplemental indenture that establishes or amends the terms of the Notes of any series and in accordance with this Article. Section 3.02 Notices to Trustee If the Company elects to redeem Notes of any series pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of such Note, it must furnish to the Trustee, at least 40 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, an Officers Certificate setting forth: (1) the clause of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur; (2) the series of Notes to be redeemed; (3) the redemption date; 13 (4) the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed; (5) the redemption price; and (6) the applicable CUSIP numbers. Section 3.03 Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed or Purchased If less than all of the Notes of any series are to be redeemed or purchased pursuant to this Indenture at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes of such series to be redeemed or purchased among the holders of Notes of such series as follows: (1) if such Notes are listed, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which such Notes are listed, or (2) if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate. In the event of partial redemption or purchase by lot, the particular Notes of any series to be redeemed or purchased will be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 35 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption or purchase date by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes of such series not previously called for redemption or purchase. The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption or purchase and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption or purchase, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed or purchased. Notes of a series and portions of such Notes selected will be in amounts of $1,000 or whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a series of a Holder are to be redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes of such series held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed or purchased. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes of a series called for redemption or purchase also apply to portions of Notes of a series called for redemption or purchase. Section 3.04 Notice of Redemption Unless otherwise indicated for a particular series by Board Resolution establishing the terms of any series of Notes as set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in an Officers Certificate, or established in a supplemental indenture hereto, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes pursuant to Article 8 hereof or a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article 11 hereof. The notice will identify the Notes of the series to be redeemed and will state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the redemption price; (3) if any Note of such series is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued upon cancellation of the original Note; (4) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (5) that Notes of such series called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest and Additional Interest, if any, on Notes of such series called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date, subject to the satisfaction of any condition to such redemption; (7) the paragraph of the Notes of such series and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes of such series called for redemption are being redeemed; and (8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes of such series. At the Companys request, the Trustee will give the notice of redemption in the Companys name and at its expense; provided, however, that the Company has delivered to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior to the redemption date (unless a shorter period is acceptable to the Trustee), an Officers Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph. 14 Section 3.05 Effect of Notice of Redemption Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.04 hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price, subject to the satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption. A notice of redemption may be conditional in that the Company may, notwithstanding the giving of the notice of redemption, condition the redemption of the Notes specified in the notice of redemption upon the completion of other transactions, such as refinancings or acquisitions (whether of the Company or by the Company). Section 3.06 Deposit of Redemption or Purchase Price On or before 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the redemption or purchase date, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption or purchase price of and accrued interest and Additional Interest, if any, on all Notes to be redeemed or purchased on that date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent will promptly return to the Company any money deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the redemption or purchase price of, and accrued interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, all Notes to be redeemed or purchased. If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption or purchase date, subject to the satisfaction of any conditions to such redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase. If a Note is redeemed or purchased on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption or purchase is not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption or purchase date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. Section 3.07 Notes Redeemed or Purchased in Part Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed or purchased in part, the Company will issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, the Trustee will authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Company a new Note of the same series equal in principal amount to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. Section 3.08 Mandatory Redemption The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. ARTICLE 4 COVENANTS Section 4.01 Payment of Notes The Company will pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, the Notes of a series on the dates and in the manner provided in accordance with the terms of such Notes and this Indenture. Principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, will be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent, if other than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof, holds as of 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the due date money deposited by the Company in immediately available funds and designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and interest then due. The Company will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal and premium, if any, at the then applicable interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest and Additional Interest (without regard to any applicable grace period) at the same rate payable on overdue principal to the extent lawful. Section 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency The Company will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The 15 Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company fails to maintain any such required office or agency or fails to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee (or at the office of its affiliate, if so designated by the Trustee). The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission will in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. The Company hereby designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, as one such office or agency of the Company in accordance with Section 2.03 hereof. Section 4.03 Reports (a) Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any series of Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee for mailing to the Holders of such series of Notes: (1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing or filings by the Company with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such forms, including a Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by the Companys certified independent accountants, and (2) all current reports that would be required to be filed by the Company with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports, in each case within 15 days of the applicable time periods specified in the SECs rules and regulations. In addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Company will file a copy of all such information and reports with the SEC for public availability (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request. The Company may deliver the consolidated reports or financial information of the Company to comply with the foregoing requirements. The Company will at all times comply with TIA  314(a). If, at any time, the Company is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, the Company will nevertheless continue filing the reports specified in the preceding paragraph with the SEC within the time periods specified above unless the SEC will not accept such a filing. The Company will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept the Companys filings for any reason, the Company will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraph on its website within the time periods that would apply if the Company were required to file those reports with the SEC.

ARTICLE 6 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01 Events of Default Each of the following is an Event of Default with respect to Notes of any series: (1) the Companys default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Notes of such series; (2) the Companys default in payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes of such series when due and payable, at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise; (3) failure by the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in this Indenture (other than an agreement that has been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Notes other than such series) or the Notes of such series for 60 days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee or by Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding voting as a single class; (4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date such series of Notes was first issued; (A) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a Payment Default), or (B) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity 18 and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $10 million or more; (5) failure by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $10 million, net of any amounts reasonably expected to be covered by insurance, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and non-appealable; (6) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case; (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case; (C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property; or (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; and (7) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case; (B) appoints a custodian of the Company or for all or substantially all of its property; or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company; and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days. Section 6.02 Acceleration If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series (other than an Event of Default with respect to clauses (6) and (7) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may declare the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, on all the Notes of such series then outstanding to be due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by Holders) specifying the Event of Default and that it is a notice of acceleration and upon delivery of such notice the principal amount, in either case, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, on all the Notes of such series then outstanding will become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in clause (6) or (7) of Section 6.01 hereof, the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, will immediately and automatically become due and payable, without the necessity of notice or any other action by any Person. Holders of the Notes of such series may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes except as provided in this Indenture. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03, and for any failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a) of the TIA, will for the 365 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the principal amount of the Notes of such series at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum. This Additional Interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest payable under this Indenture. The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes of such series from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03 or Section 314(a) of the TIA first occurs to but not excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03 or Section 314(a) of the TIA shall have been cured or waived). On such 365th day (or earlier, if the Event of Default relating to such reporting obligations is cured or waived prior to such 365th day), such Additional Interest will cease to accrue and the Notes of such series will be subject to the other remedies as provided under this Section 6.02 if the Event of Default is continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph will not affect the rights of Holders of Notes of such series in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes of such series, rescind an acceleration and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Additional Interest, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived. 19 Section 6.03 Other Remedies If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of a series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes of such series or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note of such series in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of any series then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes of such series waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences under this Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest, on the Notes of such series (including in connection with an offer to purchase) (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted solely from such acceleration). The waiver by the holders of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) of Section 6.01 of the predicating default under such Indebtedness shall be deemed a waiver of such Default or Event of Default arising under, and a rescission of any acceleration resulting from the application of clause (4), from the effective date, during the effective period and to the extent of, the waiver by the holders of such other Indebtedness. Upon any waiver granted or deemed granted in accordance with the terms hereof, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and waived for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 6.05 Control by Majority Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it with respect to the Notes of such series. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of such series of Notes, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. Section 6.06 Limitation on Suits A Holder of any series of Notes may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if: (1) such Holder gives to the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) during such 60-day period, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request. A Holder of any series of Notes may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of such series of Notes or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of Notes of such series. Section 6.07 Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest on such Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. 20 Section 6.08 Collection Suit by Trustee If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal of, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on, the Notes of all series as to which such Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. Section 6.09 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim The Trustee for each series of Notes is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. Section 6.10 Priorities If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; Second: to Holders of Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the applicable Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any and interest, respectively; and Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10. Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series. Section 6.12 Remedies Subject to Applicable Law All rights, remedies and powers provided by this Article 6 may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Indenture are intended to be subject to all applicable laws and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Indenture invalid, unenforceable or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law. 21 ARTICLE 7 TRUSTEE Section 7.01 Duties of Trustee (a) If an Event of Default with respect to Notes of any series has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will, with respect to such Notes, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs.

ARTICLE 8 LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE Section 8.01 Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance The Company may at any time, at the option of its Board evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers Certificate, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes or any series of Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8. Section 8.02 Legal Defeasance and Discharge Upon the Companys exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes of such series on the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, Legal Defeasance). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes of such series which will thereafter be deemed to be outstanding only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes of such series and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same) with respect to such series, except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium and Additional Interest, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 8.04 hereof; (2) the Companys obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof; (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Companys obligations in connection therewith; and (4) this Article 8. Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Company may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof. 25 Section 8.03 Covenant Defeasance Upon the Companys exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from each of its obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.03, 4.04, and 4.05 hereof and clause (3) of Section 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes of the applicable series (and with any additional specified terms, provisions or conditions set forth in any Board Resolution, Officers Certificate or supplemental indenture that establishes or amends the terms of the Notes of any series) on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, Covenant Defeasance), and the Notes of such series will thereafter be deemed not outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders of Notes of such series (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but will continue to be deemed outstanding for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes will not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes of such series, the Company may omit to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere in this Indenture to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision in this Indenture or in any other document and such omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes will be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Companys exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(3) through 6.01(5) hereof will not constitute Events of Default with respect to such series of Notes. Section 8.04 Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof with respect to any outstanding series of Notes: (1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of Notes of such series, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on the outstanding Notes of such series on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes of such series are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; (2) in the case of an election under Section 8.02 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that: (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of an election under Section 8.03 hereof, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) if applicable, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the funds deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof will not be subject to the rights of the holders of any Senior Indebtedness as defined in any indenture supplemental hereto applicable to the Notes of such series; (5) no Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes shall have occurred and be continuing either: (A) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from transactions occurring contemporaneously with the borrowing of funds, or the borrowing of funds, to be applied to such deposit); or (B) insofar as the occurrence of Events of Default resulting from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit (in which case such defeasance shall have been effective on the date of deposit until the time of such occurrence and, upon such occurrence, shall immediately cease to be effective); 26 (6) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound; (7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes of such series over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and (8) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with. Section 8.05 Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the Trustee) pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes of any series will be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Company will pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes of such series. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, the Trustee will deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(1) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. Section 8.06 Repayment to Company Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest on, any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note will thereafter be permitted to look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. Section 8.07 Reinstatement If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Companys obligations under this Indenture and the applicable Notes will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest on, any such Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. 27 ARTICLE 9 AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER Section 9.01 Without Consent of Holders of Notes Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Notes of one or more series without the consent of any Holder of Notes: (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes; (3) to provide for the assumption of the Companys obligations to the Holders of the Notes of any series by a successor to the Company pursuant to Article 5 hereof; (4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of all or any series of Notes (and if such additional rights or benefits are for the benefit of less than all series of Notes, stating that such additional rights or benefits are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any Holder; (5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; (6) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Notes of any series to any provision of the Description of Notes section of any prospectus or prospectus supplement or other offering document or similarly named section thereof, relating to the initial offering of such series of Notes, to the extent that such provision in that Description of Notes section of any prospectus or prospectus supplement or other offering document or similarly named section thereof was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture or the Notes of such series; (7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes of any series of Notes (including any additional or different restrictions on transfer or exchange of such Additional Notes, including without limitation those that would be appropriate if the Additional Notes were issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act) in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture prior to such issuance of Additional Notes; (8) to secure the Notes of any series; (9) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Notes (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Notes, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company; (10) to establish the form or terms of Notes of any series as permitted by this Indenture; (11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Notes of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee; or (12) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Notes, provided that any such addition, change or elimination (i) shall neither (A) apply to any Note of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (B) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Note with respect to such provision or (ii) shall become effective only when there is no Note described in clause (i) outstanding. Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Company in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee will not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. 28 Section 9.02 With Consent of Holders of Notes Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, any provisions relating to any mandatory offer by the Company to purchase or repurchase any Notes and the defined terms used therein) and the Notes, with respect to a particular series of Notes affected by such amendment or supplement, with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of such series of the Notes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a separate class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, such series of Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest on, a series of Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with respect to a particular series of Notes with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a separate class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, such series of Notes). Section 2.08 hereof shall determine which Notes are considered to be outstanding for purposes of this Section 9. Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the appropriate Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee will join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture. It is not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Company will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder): (1) reduce the principal amount of Notes of any series whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver, (2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of any series of Notes; provided, however, that any provision providing for the mandatory offer by the Company to purchase or repurchase Notes (and any related provision) shall not be deemed a provision with respect to the redemption of the Notes, (3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note, including default interest, (4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on any series of Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes of such series by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration), (5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes, (6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on the Notes, (7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note; provided, however, that any purchase or repurchase of Notes by the Company pursuant to a mandatory offer to purchase or repurchase by the Company shall not be deemed a redemption of a Note, or (8) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions. A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Notes, or that modifies the rights of the Holders of Notes of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Notes of any other series. A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture with 29 respect to one or more particular series of Notes (whether or not such covenant or other provision has expressly been included solely for the benefit of such series of Notes), or that modifies the rights of the Holders of Notes of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Notes of any other series. Section 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes of one or more series will be set forth in an amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect. Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date upon which the requisite consents for the applicable amendment, supplement or waiver have been obtained. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. Section 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company, in exchange for all Notes of a series, may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes of such series that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note of an affected series will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc The Trustee will sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Board of the Company approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be provided with and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 12.04 hereof, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Section 9.07 Reference in Notes to Supplemental Indentures Notes of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant this Article 9 and affected thereby may, if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Notes of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for outstanding Notes of such series. ARTICLE 10 SUBORDINATION Section 10.01 Agreement to Subordinate The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Note is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article, to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter Incurred), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt. No holder of Senior Debt need prove its reliance on this Article 10 to enforce the provisions hereof. Each series of Notes shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other series of Notes established under this Indenture and only Senior Debt shall rank senior to the Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. A distribution may consist of cash, securities or other property, by set-off or otherwise. 30 All Designated Senior Debt now or hereafter existing and all other Obligations relating thereto will not be deemed to have been paid in full unless the holders or owners thereof will have received payment in full in cash with respect to such Designated Senior Debt and all other Obligations with respect thereto including, without limitation, all Accrued Bankruptcy Interest. Section 10.02 Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy Upon any distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a proceeding under Bankruptcy Law relating to the Company or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Companys assets and liabilities: (1) holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full of all Obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) and to have all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations fully cash collateralized before the Trustee or the Holders will be entitled to receive any payment or distribution on Obligations with respect to the Notes (except that the Trustee or the Holders may receive payments and other distributions made from any defeasance or redemption trust created pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 hereof and the issuance of Permitted Junior Securities); and (2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in clause (1) above) are paid in full and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations are fully cash collateralized, any distribution to which the Trustee or the Holders would be entitled but for this Article 10, including any such distribution that is payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Notes, will be made to holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives, ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of the principal of such Senior Debt, interest (including, without limitation, Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) thereon and all other Obligations with respect thereto (except that Holders may receive payments and other distributions made from any defeasance or redemption trust created pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 hereof and the issuance of Permitted Junior Securities), as their respective interests may appear. Any holder of Designated Senior Debt may file any proof of claim or similar document on behalf of the Trustee or any Holder if such a document has not been filed by the date which is 30 days prior to the last day specified for filing of such documents. In any proceeding under Bankruptcy Law, neither the Trustee nor any Holder will initiate, or vote in support of, any challenge to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt. Section 10.03 Default on Designated Senior Debt (a) The Company may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or any Holder in respect of Obligations arising under or in connection with the Notes and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property (other than payments and other distributions made from any defeasance or redemption trust created pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 hereof and the issuance of Permitted Junior Securities) until all principal\\ and other Obligations arising under or in connection with the Senior Debt have been paid in full or fully cash-collateralized, if not yet due if: (1) a default in the payment of any Obligations with respect to Designated Senior Debt occurs and is continuing (including any default in payment upon the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise), or any judicial proceeding is pending to determine whether any such default has occurred; or (2) a default or event of default (as such terms may be defined in any agreement, indenture or other document governing such Designated Senior Debt), other than a payment default described in subsection (1) above, on Designated Senior Debt, including any default or event of default that would result upon any payment or distribution with respect to the Notes, that would cause or permit the acceleration of the maturity of the Designated Senior Debt, occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that permits holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a Payment Blockage Notice) from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior Debt. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice will be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until at least 360 days will have elapsed since the first day of effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default will have been waived for a period of not less than 180 days. 31 If the Company is prohibited from making payments on or distributions in respect of the Notes or from acquiring any Notes under subsection (1) or (2) above, the Company may and will resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon: (A) in the case of any prohibition referred to in Section 10. (B) in the case of any prohibition referred to in Section 10. Section 10.04 Acceleration of Notes If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company will promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration. Section 10.05 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over If, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.02 and 10.03, any direct or indirect payment or distribution on account of principal of or interest on or other Obligations with respect to the Notes or acquisition, repurchase, redemption, retirement or defeasance of any of the Notes will be made by or on behalf of the Company (including any payments or distribution by any liquidating trustee or agent or other Person in a proceeding referred to in Section 10.02) and received by the Trustee or any Holder at a time when such payment or distribution was prohibited by the provisions of Section 10.02 or 10.03 or such payment or distribution was required to be made to holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives, then, unless and until such payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by Section 10.02 or 10.03, such payment or distribution will be received, segregated from other funds or assets and held in trust by the Trustee or such Holder, as the case may be, for the benefit of, and will be immediately paid or delivered over to, those Persons known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, as, or identified by the Company as, or to a fund for the benefit of, the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives, ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of the principal of such Senior Debt, interest (including, without limitation, Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) thereon and all other Obligations with respect thereto held or represented by each, until the principal of all Senior Debt, interest (including Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) thereon and all other Obligations with respect thereto have been paid in full and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations have been fully cash collateralized. Any distribution to the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives of assets other than cash may be held by such holders or such Representatives as additional collateral without any duty to the Holder to liquidate or otherwise realize on such assets or to apply such assets to any Senior Debt or other Obligations relating thereto. With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt will be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and will not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee in good faith mistakenly pays over or distributes to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt are entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee. Nothing in this Section 10.05 will affect the obligation of any Person other than the Trustee to hold such payment or distribution for the benefit of, and to pay or deliver such payment or distribution over to, the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives. Section 10.06 Notice by Company The Company will promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice will not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article 10. Section 10.07 Subrogation After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders will be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on the Notes. 32 Section 10.08 Relative Rights This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Article 10 will: (1) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, the Notes in accordance with their terms; (2) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or (3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders. If the Company fails because of this Article to pay principal of or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on, a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default. Section 10.09 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Company No right of any present or future holder of Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes will be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder of Notes or any holder of Senior Debt or by the failure of the Company or any Holder of Notes or any holder of Senior Debt to comply with this Indenture regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such Holder of Notes or holder of Senior Debt, as the case may be, may have or be otherwise charged with. The holders of Senior Debt may extend, renew, restate, supplement, modify or amend the terms of the Senior Debt or any Obligations with respect thereto or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange such security and otherwise deal freely with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates all without affecting the liabilities and obligations of the parties to this Indenture or the Holders. No provision in any supplemental indenture that adversely affects the subordination of the Notes or other provisions of this Article 10 will be effective against the holders of the Designated Senior Debt unless the requisite percentage of such holders (or if permitted under the applicable Senior Debt governing agreement, the Representative) will have consented thereto. Each Holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof: (a) acknowledges and agrees that the holders of any Senior Debt or their Representative, in its or their discretion, and without affecting any rights of any holder of Senior Debt under this Article 10, may foreclose any mortgage or deed of trust covering interest in real property securing such Senior Debt or any guarantee thereof by judicial or nonjudicial sale, even though such action may release the Company or any guarantor of such Senior Debt from further liability under such Senior Debt or any guarantee thereof or may otherwise limit the remedies available to the holders thereof; and (b) hereby waives any defense that such Holder may otherwise have to the enforcement of this Article 10 by any holder of any Senior Debt or any Representative of such holder against such Holder after or as a result of any action, including any such defense based on any loss or impairment of rights of subrogation. If at any time any payment of Obligations with respect to any Senior Debt is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation of the Company or otherwise, the provisions of this Article 10 will continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, to the same extent as though such payments had not been made. Section 10.10 Distribution or Notice to Representative Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders will be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10. 33 Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee will be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee or agent on behalf of any such holder). In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 10, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment which it may be required to make for the benefit of such Person pursuant to the terms of this Indenture pending judicial determination as to the rights of such Person to receive such payment. Section 10.11 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at least two Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article. Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 10 will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. Section 10.12 Authorization to Effect Subordination Each Holder of a Note by the Holders acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holders behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holders attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. The Company, the Trustee and each Holder by their acceptance of the Notes acknowledge that damages may be inadequate to compensate the holders of Senior Debt for any breach or default by the Company, the Trustee or any such Holder of its obligations under this Article 10, and, therefore, agree that the holders of Senior Debt and their Representatives will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the enforcement thereof. Section 10.13 Amendments The provisions of this Article 10 will not be amended or modified without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt (or their Representatives as permitted thereunder) unless such amendment or modification does not adversely affect the holders of such Senior Debt. [Section 10.14 Notes are Pari Passu with the Existing Senior Subordinated Notes Notwithstanding anything else in this Indenture, the Obligations in respect of the Notes will be on a parity with the Obligations in respect of the Existing Senior Subordinated Notes in right of payment.] ARTICLE 11 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE Section 11.01 Satisfaction and Discharge This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes of a particular series issued hereunder, when: (1) either: (A) all Notes of such series that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company, have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or 34 (B) all Notes of such series that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption (and all conditions to such redemption having been satisfied or waived) or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.

Upon compliance with the foregoing, the Trustee shall execute proper instrument(s) acknowledging the satisfaction and discharge of all the Companys obligations under the Notes of such series and this Indenture. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if trust funds have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section 11.01, the provisions of Sections 11.02 and 8.06 hereof will survive. In addition, nothing in this Section 11.01 will be deemed to discharge those provisions of Section 7.07 hereof, that, by their terms, survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Section 11.02 Application of Trust Money Subject to the provisions of Section 8.06 hereof, all trust funds deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 hereof shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes of a particular series and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium and Additional Interest, if any) and interest for whose payment such trust funds have has been deposited with the Trustee; but such trust funds need not be segregated from other funds or securities except to the extent required by law. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any trust funds in accordance with this Section 11.02 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Companys obligations under this Indenture and the Notes of such series shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.01 hereof; provided that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest on, any Notes of such series because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes of such series to receive such payment from the trust funds held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may declare all the Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding Notes of such series will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes of such series except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Notes of such series. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes of such series notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest or premium or Additional Interest, if any) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) rescind an acceleration and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Additional Interest, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived or (ii) waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium or Additional Interest, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series.

In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon them by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may exercise all powers of the Corporation and do all lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 7 Section 2.Number, Election and Term of Office.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specific circumstances, the number of directors which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be between two (2) and eleven (11), to be fixed exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors. The initial number of directors shall be two (2). The directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election of directors. Effective upon the consummation of the Corporations initial public offering of securities, the directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III.

At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning at the first meeting of stockholders to occur after the Corporations initial public offering, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that Annual Meeting shall be elected for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class or from the removal from office, death, disability, resignation or disqualification of a director or other cause shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article III, directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders. Section 3.Removal and Resignation.  Any director may resign at any time upon delivery of written notice of such resignation, signed by such director, to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time is specified, at the time of its receipt. Any director may be removed at any time, but only for cause upon the affirmative vote of not less than 66-2/3% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors at any meeting of such stockholders, including meetings called expressly for that purpose. Section 4.Vacancies.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specific circumstances and unless otherwise provided by the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, 8 though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a vote of a majority vote of the holders of the Corporations outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. Each director so chosen shall hold office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal as herein provided. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. No decrease in the number of authorized directors constituting the whole Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Section 5.Annual and Regular Meetings.  The annual meeting of the Board of Directors for the purpose of electing officers and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting shall be held as soon as possible following adjournment of the annual meeting of the stockholders at the place of such annual meeting of the stockholders. Notice of such annual meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given. The Board of Directors from time to time may by resolution provide for the holding of regular meetings and fix the place (which may be within or without the State of Delaware), date and time of such meetings. Notice of regular meetings need not be given; provided, however, that if the Board of Directors shall fix or change the time or place of any regular meeting, notice of such action shall be mailed promptly, or sent by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic means to each director who shall not have been present at the meeting at which such action was taken, addressed to him or her at his or her usual place of business, or shall be delivered to him or her personally. Section 6.Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, or by a majority of the directors, at such place, date and time as may be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice of such meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called on at least twenty-four (24) hours notice to each director or such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances, if notice is given to each director personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic means, or on three (3) days notice from the official date of deposit in the mail if notice is mailed to each director, addressed to him or her at his or her usual place of business. Such notice need not state the purpose or purposes of, nor the business to be transacted at, such meeting, except as may otherwise be required by law or provided for by the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. A meeting may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are present or if those not present waive notice of the meeting in writing either before or after such meeting. Section 7.Quorum, Required Vote and Adjournment.  A majority of the total number of directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Except as otherwise provided by the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable law, the vote of a majority of directors present at a meeting at which 9 a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. Section 8.Organization.  Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence by the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or in his or her absence by the Chief Executive Officer of the President, if any, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. Section 9.Telephonic Meetings.  Members of the Board of Directors may participate in and act at any meeting of the Board of Directors through the use of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in the meeting pursuant to this section shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Section 10.Waiver of Notice and Presumption of Assent.  Any member of the Board of Directors who is present at a meeting shall be conclusively presumed to have waived notice of such meeting except when such member attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Such member shall be conclusively presumed to have assented to any action taken unless his or her dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless his or her written dissent to such action shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to any member who voted in favor of such action. Section 11.Action by Written Consent.  Unless otherwise restricted by the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board of Directors consent thereto in writing, and the writing(s) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors. Section 12.Reliance on Accounts and Reports, etc.  A director shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Corporation and upon information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Corporation by any of the Corporations officers or employees, or committees designated by the Board of Directors, or by any other person as to the matters the director reasonably believes are within such other persons professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Corporation. Section 13.Compensation of Directors.  Directors, as such, may receive, pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors, fixed fees, other compensation for their services as directors and reimbursement of expenses, including, without limitation, their services as members of 10 committees of the Board of Directors. No such fixed fees, other compensation or reimbursement shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. ARTICLE IV COMMITTEES Section 1.Committees.  The Board of Directors shall, by resolution passed by a majority of the directors, designate a compensation committee, a nominating and governance committee, an audit committee and, from time to time, such other committees to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Each committee shall consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation, which to the extent permitted by law and provided in such resolution or these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management and affairs of the Corporation. Such committee(s) shall have such name(s) as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of the committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in place of any such absent or disqualified member. Section 2.Committee Rules.  Each committee of the Board of Directors may fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as provided by such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by the resolution of the Board of Directors designating such committee or the charter adopted by the Board of Directors for such committee. In the absence of such rules, each committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board of Directors conducts its business pursuant to Article III of these Bylaws.

Such other officers and agents shall have such duties as shall be provided in these Bylaws or as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or by the Chief Executive Officer. Vacancies may be filled or new offices created and filled at any meeting of the Board of Directors. Each officer shall hold office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal as hereinafter provided. Section 3.Removal and Resignation.  Any officer or agent elected by the Board of Directors may be removed by the Board of Directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the Corporation would be served thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed. Designation of an officer shall not itself create contract rights. Any officer may resign at any time upon delivery of written notice of such resignation, signed by such officer, to the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President. Unless otherwise specified therein, such resignation shall take effect upon delivery. Section 4.Vacancies.  Any vacancy occurring in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Board of Directors. Section 5.Compensation.  Compensation of all officers shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, and no officer shall be prevented from receiving such compensation by virtue of his or her also being a director of the Corporation.

In the absence of both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, the President shall preside at meetings of the stockholders and of the directors.

Each Vice President and each Assistant Vice President shall have such powers and perform all such duties as from time to time may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the senior officer to whom such officer reports. Section 9.The Secretary and Assistant Secretaries.  The Secretary shall attend all meetings of the Board of Directors, all meetings of the committees thereof and all meetings of the stockholders and record all the proceedings of the meetings in a book(s) to be kept for that purpose. Under the Chief Executive Officers or Presidents supervision, the Secretary shall (i) give, or cause to be given, all notices required to be given by these Bylaws or by law; (ii) have such powers and perform such duties as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or these Bylaws may, from time to time, prescribe; and (iii) have custody of the corporate seal of the Corporation.

The Assistant Secretary, or if there be more than one, the Assistant Secretaries in the order determined by the Board of Directors, shall, in the absence or disability of the Secretary, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Secretary. The Assistant Secretaries shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or Secretary may, from time to time, prescribe.

In the case of the absence or disability of any officer of the Corporation and of any person hereby authorized to act in such officers place during such officers absence or disability, the Board of Directors may by resolution delegate the powers and duties of such officer to any other officer or to any director, or to any other person whom it may select.

Section 14.Compensation.  The compensation of the officers of the Corporation for their services as such officers shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or quotation system applicable to the Corporation, the Board of Directors may by resolution delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the power to fix compensation of non-elected officers and agents appointed by the Chief Executive Officer. An officer of the Corporation shall not be prevented from receiving compensation by reason of the fact that such officer is also a director of the Corporation, but any such officer who shall also be a director shall not have any vote in the determination of such officers compensation. ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION Section 1.Nature of Indemnity.  The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter may be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (hereinafter, a Proceeding), whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalities and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding and any appeal therefrom, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, provided, however, that except as provided in Section 2 of this Article VI with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part 14 thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Section 2.Recovery of Unpaid Indemnification.  If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant also shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. Section 3.Successful Defense.  To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article VI or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. Section 4.Preservation of Other Rights.  The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Section 5.Insurance.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her or incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under this Article VI, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. 15 Section 6.Expenses.  Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of this Article VI in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such Proceedings final disposition and without any determination as to the persons ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of a written affirmation by such person of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Article VI and a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise. Section 7.Employees and Agents.  Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article VI and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors. The expenses incurred by such employees and agents may also be paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate. Section 8.Contract Rights.  The provisions of this Article VI shall be deemed to be a contract right, and any repeal or modification of this Article VI or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing. Section 9.Severability.  If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer and any other person indemnified pursuant to this Article VI as to costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 10.Appearance as a Witness.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director or officer in connection with his or her appearance as a witness or other participation in a Proceeding at a time when he or she is not a named defendant or respondent in the Proceeding. ARTICLE VII CAPITAL STOCK Section 1.Form.  Except as otherwise provided in a resolution approved by the Board of Directors, all shares of capital stock of the Corporation issued after the date hereof shall be uncertificated. In the event that the Board of Directors elects to provide in a resolution that 16 certificates shall be issued to represent any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, holders of such shares (and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares) shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation, by (i) the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or a Vice President and (ii) the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation. If such a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the Corporation or its employee, the signature of any such Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, President, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary may be facsimiles. In case any officer(s) who have signed, or whose facsimile signature(s) have been used on, any such certificate(s) shall cease to be such officer(s) of the Corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate(s) have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate(s) may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate(s) or whose facsimile signature(s) have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer(s) of the Corporation. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the Corporation. Section 2.Transfer.  Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares, duly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, the Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books. Subject to the provisions of the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may prescribe such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to the issue, transfer and registration of shares of the Corporation. Section 3.Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  The Corporation may direct a new certificate(s) of like kind to be issued in place of any certificate(s) previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate(s), the Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s), or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate. Section 4.Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings.  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted 17 by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. Section 5.Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes.  In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. Section 6.Registered Stockholders.  Prior to the surrender to the Corporation of the certificate(s) for a share(s) of stock with a request to record the transfer of such share(s), the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share(s) on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof. ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 1.Dividends.  Subject to any applicable provisions of law and the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum(s) as the Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, thinks proper as a reserve(s) to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation or for any other purpose as the Board of Directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the Board of Directors may similarly modify or abolish any such reserve. 18 Section 2.Checks, Drafts or Orders.  All checks, drafts or other orders for the payment of money by the Corporation and all notes and other evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer(s) or agent(s) of the Corporation, and in such manner, as shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof.

The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise. Section 6.Voting Securities Owned By Corporation.  Voting securities in any other corporation held by the Corporation shall be voted by the Chief Executive Officer or President, unless the Board of Directors specifically confers authority to vote with respect thereto, which authority may be general or confined to specific instances, upon some other person or officer. Any person authorized to vote securities shall have the power to appoint proxies with general power of substitution. Section 7.Section Headings.  Section headings in these Bylaws are for convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect in limiting or otherwise construing any provision herein. Section 8.Inconsistent Provisions.

The date upon which the conversion shall be effective (the Conversion Date) shall be deemed to be the date set forth in the Conversion Notice.Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Debenture in an amount equal to the applicable conversion and payment of the interest then due. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount converted and the date of such conversions.In no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert this Debenture for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of that number of shares of Common Stock which, upon giving effect to such conversion, would cause the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates to exceed 9.99% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock following such conversion without the approval of the Company.

The Board and the Conflicts Committee will recommend approval of the Unitholder Proposals (the Recommendation), and the Partnership will take all reasonable lawful action to solicit approval of the Unitholder Proposals by the holders of Common Units and by the holders of Subordinated Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Unitholder Approvals, the Board and/or the Conflicts Committee may withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the NGP Parties the Recommendation (any such action a Change in Recommendation) if the Board and/or the Conflicts Committee (as the case may be) has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors and financial consultants, that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would either not be in the best interests of the Partnership or in the best interests of the Non-Affiliated Unitholders; provided, however, that the Board and/or the Conflicts Committee shall not be entitled to exercise its rights to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless the Partnership has provided to the NGP Parties five days prior written notice advising the NGP Parties that the Board and/or the Conflicts Committee intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail, including, if applicable, the terms and conditions of any proposed transaction that is the basis of the proposed action. Any Change in Recommendation will not change the approval of the Unitholder Proposals or any other approval of the Board and the Conflicts Committee, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the matters contemplated hereby.

The Parties will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the NGP Parties will furnish to the Partnership the information relating to the NGP Parties required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and the NGP Parties and their counsel will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Partnership and the NGP Parties will each use its commercially 27 reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other Parties, to respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

The Partnership will advise the NGP Parties promptly after it receives notice of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Unitholder Meeting any information relating to the Partnership or the NGP Parties, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Partnership or any NGP Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information will promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the holders of Common Units and Subordinated Units. The Partnership will not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, with respect to which any NGP Party reasonably objects to disclosure therein specifically regarding any NGP Party or any representative of any NGP Party (including members of the Board appointed, pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, by the NGP Representative (as defined therein)). (c) Once the Unitholder Meeting has been called and noticed, the Partnership will not postpone or adjourn the Unitholder Meeting past the Termination Date without the consent of the NGP Parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, other than (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Partnership believes in good faith is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the holders of Common Units and Subordinated Units prior to the Unitholder Meeting; provided that if the Unitholder Meeting is so delayed to a date after the Termination Date as a result of either (i) or (ii) above, then the Termination Date will be extended to the seventh Business Day after such date. (d) Each of the NGP Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that from and after the date hereof and until the earlier of (i) the first Business Day after the Unitholder Approval Date or (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (the Expiration Time), at any Unitholders Meeting, such NGP Party will, unless the Partnership directs the NGP Parties to do otherwise, (A) appear at such Unitholders Meeting or otherwise cause the Common Units and Subordinated Units beneficially owned by such NGP Party as of the relevant time (Owned Units) to be counted as present for purposes of calculating a quorum and respond to any other request by the Partnership for written consent, if any, and, (B) vote, or cause to be voted, all of its Owned Units (1) in favor of the approval of the Unitholder Proposals (whether or not recommended by the Board or the Conflicts Committee), (2) in favor of the approval of proposals made by the Partnership or the Conflicts Committee for an adjournment of the Unitholders Meeting, and (3) against any action or agreement that would reasonably be 28 expected to (a) result in a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of any NGP Party under this Agreement or (b) interfere with, delay or attempt to discourage the consummation of the Transactions. (e) Each of the NGP Parties hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, promptly to notify the Partnership of the number of any new Common Units with respect to which beneficial ownership is acquired by such NGP Party, if any, after the date hereof and before the Expiration Time. Any such Common Units shall automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement as Owned Units as though beneficially owned by such NGP Party as of the date hereof. (f) Except as provided for herein, the NGP Parties agree, from the date hereof until the Expiration Time, not to (i) directly or indirectly transfer or offer to transfer any Owned Units; (ii) tender any Owned Units into any tender or exchange offer or otherwise; or (iii) otherwise restrict the ability of the NGP Parties to freely exercise all voting rights with respect to the Owned Units. Any action attempted to be taken in violation of the preceding sentence will be null and void. (g) The Conflicts Committee shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the Partnership with respect to the matters set forth in Sections 7.2(d), 7.2(e) and 7.2(f). (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no approval of any Unitholder Proposal will be sought, and no such Unitholder Meeting will be held, if the R&M Purchase Agreement has terminated. 7.3 Further Assurances.

(d) By the NGP Parties, upon written notice to the Partnership delivered within eight Trading Days following the end of the applicable Measurement Window if the Measurement Window Average Price was less than $1.50 for such Measurement Window; provided, that no such notice may be delivered to the Partnership after the Required Unitholder Approvals are obtained. (e) By the Conflicts Committee, upon written notice to the NGP Parties delivered prior to the receipt of the Required Unitholder Approval, if at any time after the date of this Agreement, the Conflicts Committee (after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors and financial consultants) determines that terminating this Agreement in favor of a Competing Proposal is either in the best interest of the Partnership or in the best interests of the Non-Affiliated Unitholders. (f) By the NGP Parties upon written notice to the Partnership delivered prior to the Transaction Fee Payment Date, if a Material Adverse Change has occurred.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 10.1, the terminating Party will promptly give written notice thereof to the other Parties specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement will be null and void and, except as provided in Sections 10.2 and 11.1 or as otherwise expressly provided herein, no Party will have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, except that no such termination will relieve any Party from liability for damages for any willful and material breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein.

If the R&M Purchase Agreement is terminated by Black Stone because either the Partnership or any of its Affiliates breached any representation, warranty or covenant in the R&M Purchase Agreement, then the Partnership will pay to ERH, within five Business Days after such termination, the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties agree that in circumstances where payment of the Termination Fee is required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of any Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 10.2 shall be the exclusive remedy of the NGP Parties for (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated and (ii) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the Transactions. Upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 10.2, none of the Partnership Parties or any of their respective directors, Affiliates, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any further liability or obligation to the NGP Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. ARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not any or all of the Transactions are consummated and whether or not any or all of the Required Unitholder Approvals are received, the Partnership will reimburse the NGP Parties for all documented reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including reasonable attorneys fees. This Section 11.1 will survive any termination of this Agreement. 39 11.2 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto and the certificates, documents, instruments and writings that are delivered pursuant hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties in respect of its subject matters and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. There are no third party beneficiaries having rights under or with respect to this Agreement. 11.3 Successors.

The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, or covenant. 11.7 Time. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. 41 11.8 Counterparts.

No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising because of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. 11.10 Headings.

THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF EAGLE ROCK ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P. dated as of [], 2010 (this Amendment No. 1), is entered into by and among Eagle Rock Energy GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as the General Partner and as the lawful attorney-in-fact for the Limited Partners, together with any other Persons who become Partners in the Partnership or parties hereto as provided herein. WHEREAS, the General Partner and Limited Partners entered into the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P. on October 27, 2006 (the First Amended and Restated Agreement); WHEREAS, the Partnership has entered into the Securities Purchase and Global Transaction Agreement, dated December 21, 2009, among the Partnership and the other parties thereto, which contemplates, among other things, the distribution of rights and the issuance of warrants by the Partnership; and WHEREAS, this Amendment No. 1 has been approved by a Unit Majority and the General Partner. NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Section 13.2 of the First Amended and Restated Agreement, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the First Amended and Restated Agreement is hereby amended as follows: Section 1.Amendment.  (a) Section 1. (i) Right Exercised Common Unit means any Common Unit issued by the Partnership upon the exercise of a right to purchase a Common Unit (ii) Warrant Exercised Common Unit means any Common Unit issued by the Partnership upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase a Common Unit (b) Section 5. The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s). Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1. The Partnership shall follow the proposed noncompensatory option regulations under Proposed Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1, 1.721-2 and 1.761-3 at all times, including when the assets of the Partnership are revalued or any warrant is exercised in accordance with its terms. (c) Section 5. (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services or the conversion of the General Partners Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance. In accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(2), upon any exercise of a warrant, the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall immediately after such exercise be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such exercise. Any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall first be allocated to the Partners who were the initial holders of a Warrant Exercised Common Unit until the Capital Account in respect of each such Warrant Exercised Common Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit) if the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, and regardless of whether the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(c) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated. If the Unrealized Gain or -2- Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of the exercise of a warrant is not sufficient to cause the Capital Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding Warrant Exercised Common Units and the Partners holding Common Units (other than Warrant Exercised Common Units) so as to cause the Capital Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3). In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests, or immediately after the exercise of a warrant, shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines) to arrive at a fair market value for individual properties. (ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1(c) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period would have been allocated. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt. (d) Section 5. Splits, Combinations and Other Pro Rata Distributions. (a) Subject to Section 5. -3- appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Security to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any such event (but before giving effect to the exercise of any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities distributed in connection with such event), each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis (including any Common Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage) or stated as a number of Units (including the number of Subordinated Units that may convert prior to the end of the Subordination Period) are proportionately adjusted. (b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation. (c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date. (d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit). (e) Section 6. Economic Uniformity. (A) At the election of the General Partner with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the termination of the Subordination Period, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership -4- income or gain for such taxable period, after taking into account allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), shall be allocated 100% to each Partner holding Subordinated Units that are Outstanding as of the termination of the Subordination Period (Final Subordinated Units) in the proportion of the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner to the total number of Final Subordinated Units then Outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Final Subordinated Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Final Subordinated Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates immediately prior to the conversion of such Final Subordinated Units into Common Units. This allocation method for establishing such economic uniformity will be available to the General Partner only if the method for allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Subordinated Units between the transferred and retained Subordinated Units pursuant to Section 5.5(c)(ii) does not otherwise provide such economic uniformity to the Final Subordinated Units. (B) With respect to any taxable period ending after a right is exercised, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to each Partner who was the initial holder of a Right Exercised Common Unit until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Right Exercised Common Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Right Exercised Common Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit (other than a Right Exercised Common Unit) (f) Section 6. For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions, (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including gross income), gains, losses, deductions, Unrealized Gains or Unrealized Losses, and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code (including, if necessary to accomplish the intent of this Agreement, the finalization of Treasury Regulations that may differ from the Proposed Treasury Regulations relied upon in Section 5.5(d)(i) and Section 6.2(i) hereof) or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof).

Such payment and assignment shall be treated for Partnership purposes as a purchase by the Partnership from the Non-citizen Assignee of his Limited Partner Interest (representing his right to receive his share of such distribution in kind). 25 (d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner, request that with respect to any Limited Partner Interests of such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant to Section 4.

The notice shall specify the Redeemable Interests, the date fixed for redemption, the place of payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Interests and that on and after the date fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the Limited Partner would otherwise be entitled in respect of the Redeemable Interests will accrue or be made. (ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Interests shall be an amount equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be the date fixed for redemption) of Limited Partner Interests of the class to be so redeemed multiplied by the number of Limited Partner Interests of each such class included among the Redeemable Interests The redemption price shall be paid, as determined by the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest at the rate of 5% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the redemption date.

ARTICLE V CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS Section 5.1 Cancellation of Subordinated Units and Incentive Distribution Rights On the date hereof, simultaneously with the effectiveness of this Agreement (a) pursuant to a contribution agreement contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates transferred all outstanding Subordinated Units and the Incentive Distribution Rights to the Partnership and (b) the Partnership cancelled such Subordinated Units and Incentive Distribution Rights; such actions being hereby approved and ratified notwithstanding any provision of the First Amended and Restated Agreement. Section 5.2 General Partner Interest; Additional Contributions by the General Partner (a) Upon consummation of the GP Acquisition, (i) all economic rights with respect to the Partnership of the General Partner Interest, and the General Partner Units representing the General Partner Interest, including any and all rights to be allocated income, gains, losses and 27 deductions of the Partnership and to receive distributions made by the Partnership in respect of the General Partner Interest, shall automatically terminate notwithstanding Section 4.6 or any other provision of this Agreement and (ii) the Percentage Interest with respect to the General Partner Units shall automatically be reduced to zero, in each case, without further action by the Partnership or the General Partner. Following the GP Acquisition, the General Partner Interest shall continue to represent a non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership and the General Partner shall continue as the general partner of the Partnership and the Partnership will continue without dissolution. (b) Prior to the consummation of the GP Acquisition, upon the issuance of any additional Limited Partner Interests by the Partnership the General Partner may, in exchange for a proportionate number of General Partner Units, make additional Capital Contributions in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the General Partners Percentage Interest by (B) 100 less the General Partners Percentage Interest times (ii) the amount contributed to the Partnership by the Limited Partners in exchange for such additional Limited Partner Interests Except as set forth in Article XII, the General Partner shall not be obligated to make any additional Capital Contributions to the Partnership. Section 5.3 [Reserved. Section 5.4 Interest and Withdrawal No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions. No Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any, that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have priority over any other Partner either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners agree within the meaning of Section 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act. Section 5.5 Capital Accounts (a) The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner) owning a Partnership Interest (other than the non-economic General Partner Interest of the General Partner following the GP Acquisition) a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1. Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1. The Partnership shall follow the proposed noncompensatory option regulations under Proposed Treasury Regulation 28 Sections 1.704-1, 1.721-2 and 1.761-3 at all times, including when the assets of the Partnership are revalued or any warrant is exercised in accordance with its terms. (b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is to be allocated pursuant to Article VI and is to be reflected in the Partners Capital Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for that purpose), provided, that: (i) Solely for purposes of this Section 5.5, the Partnership shall be treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the General Partner based upon the provisions of the applicable Group Member Agreement or governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property owned by (x) any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company, unincorporated business or other entity classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes of which a Group Member is, directly or indirectly, a partner. (ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. (iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain or loss. (iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Partnerships Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date. (v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 5.5(d) to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property 29 subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment. (vi) If the Partnerships adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1. Any restoration of such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent possible, be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such deemed deduction was allocated. (c)A (d) (i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services or the conversion of the General Partners Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance. In accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(2), upon any exercise of a warrant, the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall immediately after such exercise be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such exercise. Any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall first be allocated to the Partners who were the initial holders of a Warrant Exercised Common Unit until the Capital Account in respect of each such Warrant Exercised Common Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit) if the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, and regardless of whether the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(c) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated. If the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of the exercise of a warrant is not sufficient to cause the Capital Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding Warrant Exercised Common Units and the Partners holding Common Units (other than Warrant Exercised Common Units) so as to cause the Capital 30 Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3). In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests, or immediately after the exercise of a warrant, shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines) to arrive at a fair market value for individual properties. (ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt. Section 5.6 Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities (a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership Securities for any Partnership purpose at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all without the approval of any Limited Partners (b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the Partnership pursuant to Section 5. 31 the terms and conditions upon which each Partnership Security will be issued, evidenced by certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Security; and (viii) the right, if any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership matters, including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges of such Partnership Security. (c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5. The General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities being so issued. The General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with any future issuance of Partnership Securities or in connection with the conversion of the General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership Securities are listed or admitted to trading. (d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership Section 5.7 [Reserved. Section 5.8 Limited Preemptive Right Except as provided in this Section 5.8 and in Section 5.2, no Person shall have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the issuance of any Partnership Security, whether unissued, held in the treasury or hereafter created. Prior to the consummation of the GP Acquisition, the General Partner shall have the right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to purchase Partnership Securities from the Partnership whenever, and on the same terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Securities to Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its Affiliates equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such Partnership Securities. The right of the General Partner to purchase Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall automatically terminate upon the consummation of the GP Acquisition. Section 5.9 Splits, Combinations and Other Pro Rata Distributions (a) Subject to Section 5. 32 in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted. (b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation. (c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date. (d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit). Section 5.10 Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner Interests All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 and Section 17-804 of the Delaware Act and any successor or other applicable provisions of the Delaware Act.

Allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(e)(xi)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(e)(xi)(A) shall be deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) hereof to the extent the General Partner determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations. (B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply the provisions of Section 6. Section 6.2 Allocations for Tax Purposes 38 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of book income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6. (b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows: (i) (A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under Section 704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the Agreed Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of contribution; and (B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of book gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1. (ii) (A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1) first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof pursuant to Section 5.5(d)(i) or Section 5.5(d)(ii), and (2) second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with Section 6.2(b)(i)(A); and (B) any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of book gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1. (iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities, except as otherwise determined by the General Partner with respect to goodwill. (c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions, (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including gross income), gains, losses, deductions, Unrealized Gains or Unrealized Losses, and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code (including, if necessary to accomplish the intent of this Agreement, the finalization of Treasury Regulations that may differ from the Proposed Treasury Regulations relied upon in Section 5. The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.2(c) only if such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code. 39 (d) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the Partnerships common basis of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with Treasury Regulation Section 1. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnerships property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests. (e) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1. (f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the provisions of this Article VI shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of Limited Partner Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method determined by the General Partner 40 (i) If Capital Account balances are reallocated between the Partners in accordance with Section 5.

Except as set forth in Section 7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

If the General Partner is removed by the Unitholders under circumstances where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under circumstances where such withdrawal violates this Agreement, and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (or if the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 12.2 and the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner), such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing General Partner (or, in the event the business of the Partnership is continued, prior to the date the business of the Partnership is continued), to purchase the Combined Interest for such fair market value of such Combined Interest of the Departing General Partner. In either event, the Departing General Partner shall be entitled to receive all reimbursements due such Departing General Partner pursuant to Section 7.4, including any employee-related liabilities (including severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the termination of any employees employed by the Departing General Partner or its Affiliates (other than any Group Member) for the benefit of the Partnership or the other Group Members. For purposes of this Section 11.3(a), the fair market value of the Departing General Partners Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the Departing General Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after the effective date of such Departing General Partners departure, by an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing General Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other experts, and the determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If such parties cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent expert within 45 days after the effective date of such departure, then the Departing General Partner shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, the Departing General Partners successor shall designate an independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or independent expert, which third independent investment banking firm or other independent expert shall determine the fair market value of the Combined Interest 62 of the Departing General Partner.

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in Section 11. Any successor General Partner shall indemnify the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) as to all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising on or after the date on which the Departing General Partner (or its transferee) becomes a Limited Partner.

Section 13.9 Quorum and Voting Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which a meeting has been called (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater percentage of such Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this Agreement at which 73 a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote and be present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to such action under the provisions of this Agreement, applicable law, or the rules of an applicable National Securities Exchange, in which case the act of the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such greater or different percentage shall be required.

Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period, which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the Limited Partners, the 74 Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals are deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited Partners limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners. Section 13.12 Right to Vote and Related Matters (a) Only those Record Holders of the Units on the Record Date set pursuant to Section 13. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units. (b) With respect to Units that are held for a Persons account by another Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation, or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered, such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry The provisions of this Section 13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to the provisions of Section 4.3.

Signature Date: Signature SUMMARY OF CERTAIN TERMS OF WARRANT AGREEMENT The Warrant Agreement shall contain the following terms, together with such other terms reasonably agreed to by the Partnership and the warrant agent: 1. Exercise of Warrants Warrants may be exercised at any time from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. New York City Time on each of the Exercise Dates prior to the Expiration Date. In order to exercise all or any of the Warrants represented by this Warrant Certificate, the holder must deliver this Warrant Certificate and the form of election to purchase duly filled in and signed, which signature shall be medallion guaranteed by an institution which is a member of a Securities Transfer Association recognized signature guarantee program, and upon payment to the Warrant Agent for the account of the Partnership of the Exercise Price, as adjusted as provided herein, for the number of Warrant Units in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised. 2. Certain Adjustments The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Units issuable upon exercise of the Warrants will be subject to adjustment from time to time. Unit Distributions and Splits. If the Partnership, at any time while the Warrants are outstanding, (i) makes a distribution on its Common Units that is payable in Common Units, (ii) subdivides outstanding Common Units into a larger number, or (iii) combines outstanding Common Units into a smaller number, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Common Units outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of Common Units outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of unitholders entitled to receive such distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this paragraph, the number of Warrant Units that may be purchased upon exercise of a Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, as applicable, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the Warrant Units shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while the Warrants are outstanding, (A) the Partnership effects any merger or consolidation of the Partnership with or into (whether or not the Partnership is the surviving entity) another person or (B) the Partnership effects any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, in each of cases (A) and (B) above, pursuant to which the Common Units are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination of Common Units described above) (in any such case, a Fundamental Transaction), then the holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of a Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Units then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant Certificate. Calculations. All calculations shall be made to the nearest cent. If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Common Units would otherwise result in the issuance of fractional Warrant Units, each fractional Warrant Unit shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole Warrant Unit. Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment, the Partnership at its expense will promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant Certificate and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Units or other securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (as applicable), describing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. The Partnership will promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Warrant Agent. 3. Global Certificates; Exchanges The Warrant Agreement shall provide for a global warrant certificate to be held by the Depositary Trust Company (or its designee). The global certificate shall be subject to customary exchange, transfer and registration provisions. 4. Amendments and Modifications The Partnership may, without the consent of the holders, by supplemental agreement or otherwise, make any changes or corrections in the Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement that are required to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein; provided that such changes or corrections shall not adversely affect the interests of holders of then outstanding Warrants in any material respect. The Warrant Certificate and the Warrant Agreement may also be amended or waived with the consent of the Partnership and the holder. Further, the Partnership may, with the consent, in writing or at a meeting, of the holders of the then outstanding Warrants exercisable for a majority or greater of the Common Units issuable under such Warrants at that time, amend in any way, by supplemental agreement or otherwise, the Warrant Certificate and/or all of the outstanding Warrants; provided, however, that (i) no such amendment by its express terms shall adversely affect any holder differently than it affects all other holders, unless such adversely affected holder consents thereto, and (ii) no such amendment concerning the number of Warrant Units or Exercise Price shall be made unless any holder who will be affected by such amendment consents thereto.", "section_full_title": "1.2 Certain Interpretive Matters", "document_id": "1E1w7SzQ8ZwoDEz4Pf4lRd.", "section_title": " Certain Interpretive Matters"}, {"text": " The Subscriber represents and warrants that this Agreement, when executed and delivered to the Company, will constitute the Subscribers valid and legally binding obligation, except to the extent the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy laws, insolvency laws, reorganization laws, moratorium laws or other laws affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable principles.", "section_full_title": "3.1 Authorization", "document_id": "1E7XxSctOZ1kmCL3gRr3Sq.", "section_title": " Authorization"}, {"text": " (a) This Agreement is made with the Subscriber in reliance upon Subscribers representations to the Company, which by the Subscribers acceptance hereof, the Subscriber hereby confirms, that (i) the Shares to be received by the Subscriber will be acquired by the Subscriber for investment for his or her own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part thereof, (ii) he or she has no current intention of selling, granting a participation in or otherwise distributing the same in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws, and (iii) the information contained in the form of Confidential Investment Qualification Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Purchaser Questionnaire) and completed by the Subscriber and delivered to the Company is true, correct, accurate and complete both as of the date of such Purchaser Questionnaire and as of the date hereof. By executing this Agreement, the Subscriber further represents that he or she does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or grant a participation to such person, or to any third person, with respect to any of the Shares.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken.

If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Companys expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106. With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto that sets such record date may designate any day as the Expiration Date and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto that set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE OR IN PART FOR A SECURITY REGISTERED, AND NO TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART MAY BE REGISTERED, IN THE NAME OF ANY PERSON OTHER THAN SUCH DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE THEREOF, EXCEPT IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE.

U.S. As Trustee By: Authorized Signatory Dated: SECTION 204.Securities in Global Form.  If Securities of or within a series are issuable in global form, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, notwithstanding Clause (3) of Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such Security shall represent such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or Section 304. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable, Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order.

The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any Security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Security in global from together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with 11 regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of Section 303.

If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. SECTION 302.Denominations.  Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, any Securities of such series, other than Securities issued in global form (which may be of any denomination), shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000. SECTION 303.Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.  The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Chief Financial Officer, its Treasurer or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating: (1) if the forms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and 15 (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the two preceding paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraphs at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. SECTION 304.Temporary Securities.  Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of that series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and like aggregate principal amount and tenor. Until exchanged in full as hereinafter provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder. 16 SECTION 305.Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.  The Company shall cause to be kept at an office or agency to be maintained by the Company in accordance with Section 1002 a register (being the combined register of the Security Registrar and all transfer agents designated pursuant to Section 1002 for the purpose of registration of transfer of Securities and sometimes collectively referred to as the Security Register) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and the registration of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed Security Registrar for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or any transfer agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer. If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. SECTION 306.Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.  If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new 17 Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 307.Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.  Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called Defaulted Interest) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are 18 registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 308.Persons Deemed Owners.  Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 305 and Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 309.Cancellation.  All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order. SECTION 310.Computation of Interest.  Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. SECTION 311.CUSIP Numbers The Company in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use such CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will notify the Trustee of any change CUSIP numbers. 19 ARTICLE IV SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 401.Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.  This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for, and any right to receive additional amounts, as provided in Section 1009), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities for the payment of which money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation: (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of Section 401(1)(B)(i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge. 20 SECTION 402.Application of Trust Money.  Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and interest for the payment of which such money has been deposited with the Trustee. ARTICLE V REMEDIES SECTION 501.Events of Default.  Event of Default, wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of or any premium on any Security of that series at its Maturity and (if so established as contemplated by Section 301 in respect of that series), in the case of technical or administrative difficulties only if such default persists for a period of five days; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of a Security of that series, in the case of technical or administrative difficulties only if such a default persists for a period of five days; or (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a Notice of Default hereunder; or (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or 21 (6) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, of the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. SECTION 502.Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.  If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and 22 (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 503.Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.  The Company covenants that if: (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, in the case of technical or administrative difficulties only if such a default persists for a period of five days, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances, of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem reasonably necessary to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 504.Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.  In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent 23 to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607. No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditors or other similar committee. SECTION 505.Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.  All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 506.Application of Money Collected.  Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607; SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto. SECTION 507.Limitation on Suits.  No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; 24 (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 508.Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 509.Restoration of Rights and Remedies.  If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 510.Rights and Remedies Cumulative.  Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 511.Delay or Omission Not Waiver.  No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. 25 SECTION 512.Control by Holders.  The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that: (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 513.Waiver of Past Defaults.  The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default: (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 514.Undertaking for Costs.  In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses against any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company. SECTION 515.Waiver of Usury, Stay or Extension Laws.  The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. 26 ARTICLE VI THE TRUSTEE SECTION 601.Certain Duties and Responsibilities.  The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. SECTION 602.Notice of Defaults.  If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such default as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act; provided, however, that in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term default means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of such series. SECTION 603.Certain Rights of Trustee.  Subject to the provisions of Section 601: (1) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document (whether in its original or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers Certificate; (4) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its own selection and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; 27 (6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; (7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (8) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered, or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; (9) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Event of Default or any event which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture; and (10) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and the Person employed to act hereunder. SECTION 604.Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.  The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustees certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. SECTION 605.May Hold Securities.  The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. SECTION 606.Money Held in Trust.  Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

SECTION 608.Conflicting Interests.  If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture. To the extent permitted by such Act, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being a trustee under this Indenture with respect to Securities of more than one series. SECTION 609.Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.  There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and, is subject to supervision or examination by federal, state or District of Columbia authority and is not otherwise ineligible under Section 310(a)(5) of the Trust Indenture Act. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 610.Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.  No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611. The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. 29 The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities of such series and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 611.Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.  In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; 30 but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. The successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to the Holders. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 612.Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.  Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. SECTION 613.Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.  If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of Section 311 of the Trust Indenture Act, but only to the extent therein specified, regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of such Act, the following terms shall mean: 31 (a) cash transaction means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and (b) self-liquidating paper means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation SECTION 614.Appointment of Authenticating Agent.  The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, and a copy of such evidence shall be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustees certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. 32 The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 607. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustees certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form: This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

SECTION 902.Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.  With the consent of the Holders of not less than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby: (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change any obligation of the Company to pay additional amounts pursuant to Section 1009 (except as contemplated by Section 801(1) and permitted by Section 901(1)), or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502, or change 36 any Place of Payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or any premium or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or (3) make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any Security or decreases the conversion or exchange rate or increases the conversion price of any convertible or exchangeable Security, or (4) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1008, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this Clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to the Trustee and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 1008, or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 611 and 901(7). A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders of Securities under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. SECTION 903.Execution of Supplemental Indentures.  In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. SECTION 904.Effect of Supplemental Indentures.  Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby. SECTION 905.Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.  Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act. 37 SECTION 906.Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.  Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series. ARTICLE X COVENANTS SECTION 1001.Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.  The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of Holders of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this Indenture. SECTION 1002.Maintenance of Office or Agency.  The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such respective presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. SECTION 1003.Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.  If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. 38 The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (1) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (2) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in respect of the Securities of that series. The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and any premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company. SECTION 1004.Statement by Officers as to Default.  The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers Certificate, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge. SECTION 1005.Existence.  Subject to Article VIII, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the ability of the Company to make payments hereunder. 39 SECTION 1006.Maintenance of Properties.  The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the ability of the Company to make payments hereunder. SECTION 1007.Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.  The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith. SECTION 1008.Waiver of Certain Covenants.  Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series, the Company may, with respect to the Securities of any series, omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any covenant provided pursuant to Section 301(12), 901(2) or 901(7) for the benefit of the Holders of such series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least 50% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect. SECTION 1009.Additional Amounts  If the Securities of a series provide for the payment of additional amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series additional amounts as provided therein. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on, or in respect of, any Security of any series or the net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional amounts provided for in this Section to the extent that, in such context, additional amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section and express mention of the payment of additional amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made. 40 ARTICLE XI REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES SECTION 1101.Applicability of Article.  Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities) in accordance with this Article. SECTION 1102.Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.  The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution or in another manner specified as contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series (including any such redemption affecting only a single Security), the Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date, of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of a specified tenor are to be redeemed). In the case of any redemption of Securities (i) prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, or (ii) pursuant to an election of the Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition. SECTION 1103.Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.  If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed (unless all the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed or unless such redemption affects only a single Security), the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or of the principal amount of global securities of such series. If less than all of the Securities of such series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series and specified tenor not previously called for redemption in accordance with the preceding sentence. If so specified in the Securities of a series, partial redemptions must be in an amount not less than $1,000,000 principal amount of Securities. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. 41 SECTION 1104.Notice of Redemption.  Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106 to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed, (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, (5) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, (6) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and (7) applicable CUSIP numbers, if any. A notice of redemption published as contemplated by Section 106 need not identify particular Registered Securities to be redeemed. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Companys request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. SECTION 1105.Deposit of Redemption Price.  Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 1106.Securities Payable on Redemption Date.  Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of 42 such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Holder of securities covered by the Registration Statement severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement shall be acknowledged by each Notice Holder that is not Hochschild in such Notice Holders Notice and Questionnaire and shall be in addition to any liability that any such Notice Holder may otherwise have. 10 (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses or otherwise materially prejudices the indemnifying party; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel (including one local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

(d) If the indemnification to which an indemnified party is entitled under this Section 7 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient although applicable in accordance with its terms to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, 11 liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders of the Registrable Securities on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied in writing by the Company or in writing by the Holder of the Registrable Securities and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Holder of any Registrable Securities shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received from the sale of the Registrable Securities by such Holder of Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder of Registrable Securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7(d), each person, if any, who controls Hochschild or any Holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Hochschild or such Holder, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. 12 (e) The provisions of this Section 7 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 7, and shall survive the sale by a Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement.", "section_full_title": "SECTION 7.Indemnification and Contribution", "document_id": "1gSpQJeKuF8YWFRwu8UmvZ.", "section_title": "Indemnification and Contribution"}, {"text": "  (a) Successors and Assigns Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided however that this Agreement may be assigned by the Holder in connection with the transfer of all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities to any Affiliate of the Holder.

(the Agent) or any other Person regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Holder nor any affiliate (as defined by Rule 405 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act) of the Holder which (i) had knowledge of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) has or shares discretion relating to the Holders investments and trading or information concerning the Holders investments and (iii) is subject to the Holders review or input concerning such affiliates investments or trading (collectively, Trading Affiliates) has directly or indirectly, nor has any Person acting on behalf of or pursuant to any understanding with the Holder or any Trading Affiliate, effected or agreed to effect any transactions in the securities of NGAS. The Holder hereby covenants and agrees not to, and shall cause its Trading Affiliates not to, engage, directly or indirectly, in any transactions in the securities of NGAS or involving NGASs securities during the period from the date hereof until such time as (a) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are first publicly announced as described in Section 4.3 hereof or (b) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.

NGAS shall maintain the Common Shares authorization for quotation on the Principal Market. Neither NGAS nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action which would be reasonably expected to result in the delisting or suspension of the Common Shares on the Principal Market; provided, however, that NGAS makes no covenant regarding the trading price of the Common Shares. NGAS shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligations under this Section 4.9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with a Change of Control, the Company will comply with the provision of Section 4.16 in lieu of this Section. 4.10 Participation Right. Until the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, and with respect to any Holder as long as 75% of their 2009 Notes remain outstanding, NGAS will not, directly or indirectly, effect any Subsequent Placement unless NGAS shall have first complied with this Section 4.10; provided, that the Company shall not be required to comply with this Section 4.10 during the six-month period immediately following Closing if such Subsequent Placement (i) would be integrated with the Exchange for purposes of the Securities Act or any applicable shareholder approval provisions, including, without limitation, under the rules and regulations of any exchange or automated quotation system on which any of the securities of NGAS are listed or designated, and (ii) does not involve more than $5,000,000 of the Companys securities or the issuance of Common Shares for a purchase price of less than $1.00 per share. (a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to any proposed or intended Subsequent Placement, NGAS or its agent shall orally contact the Holder and ask whether such Holder is willing to agree to receive material non-public information (each such notice, a Pre-Notice), provided that neither NGAS nor its agents shall provide any material, non-public information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Holder without the expressed written consent of the Holder to receive such material, non-public information. Upon the written request of the Holder no later than one (1) Business Day after the Holders receipt of such Pre-Notice, and only upon a written request by the Holder, NGAS shall promptly, but no later than one (1) Business Day after such request, deliver to the Holder by facsimile an irrevocable written notice (the Offer Notice) of any proposed or intended issuance or sale or exchange (the Offer) of the securities being offered (the Offered Securities) in a Subsequent Placement within one (1) Business Day of the determination of the terms of such Subsequent Placement, which Offer Notice shall (w) identify and describe the Offered Securities, (x) describe the price and other final terms upon which they are to be issued, sold or exchanged, and the number or amount of the Offered Securities to be issued, sold or exchanged, (y) identify the persons or entities (if known) to which or with which the Offered Securities are to be offered, issued, sold or exchanged and (z) offer to issue and sell to or exchange with the Holder (which offer being non-transferable to any successor to the Holder) a pro rata portion of at least 25% of the Offered Securities allocated among the Holder and the Other Note Holders (as defined herein) (a) based on the Holders pro rata portion of all the 2009 Notes (the Basic Amount), and (b) if the Holder elects to purchase its Basic Amount, any additional portion of the Offered Securities attributable to the Basic Amounts of the Other Note Holders as the Holder shall indicate it will purchase or acquire should the Other Note Holders subscribe for less than their Basic Amounts (the Undersubscription Amount). (b) To accept an Offer, in whole or in part, the Holder must deliver a written notice to NGAS prior to the end of the first (1st) full Business Day after the Holders receipt of the Offer Notice (for purposes of this Section 4.10(b), receipt of the Offer Notice shall not be deemed to have occurred until the Holder shall have physically received such Offer Notice) (the Offer Period), setting forth the portion of the Holders Basic Amount that the Holder elects to purchase and, if the Holder shall elect to purchase all of its Basic Amount, the Undersubscription Amount, if any, that the Holder elects to purchase (in either case, the Notice of Acceptance). If the Basic Amounts subscribed for by the Holder and all Other Note Holders are less than the total of all of the Basic Amounts, then, if the Holder has set forth an Undersubscription Amount in its Notice of Acceptance, the Holder shall be entitled to purchase, in addition to the Basic Amounts subscribed for, the Undersubscription Amount it has subscribed for; provided, however, that if the Undersubscription Amounts subscribed for exceed the difference between the total of all the Basic Amounts and the Basic Amounts subscribed for (the Available Undersubscription Amount), 10 if the Holder has subscribed for any Undersubscription Amount, then the Holder shall be entitled to purchase only that portion of the Available Undersubscription Amount as the Basic Amount of the Holder bears to the total Basic Amounts of all Other Note Holders that have subscribed for Undersubscription Amounts, subject to rounding by NGAS to the extent it deems reasonably necessary. (c) NGAS shall have thirty (30) Business Days from the expiration of the Offer Period above to offer, issue, sell or exchange all or any part of such Offered Securities as to which a Notice of Acceptance has not been given by the Holder (the Refused Securities), but only to the offerees described in the Offer Notice (if so described therein) and only upon terms and conditions (including, without limitation, unit prices and interest rates) that are not more favorable to the acquiring Person or Persons or less favorable to NGAS than those set forth in the Offer Notice. (d) In the event NGAS shall propose to sell less than all the Refused Securities (any such sale to be in the manner and on the terms specified in Section 4.10(c) above), then the Holder may, at its sole option and in its sole discretion, reduce the number or amount of the Offered Securities specified in its Notice of Acceptance to an amount that shall be not less than the number or amount of the Offered Securities that the Holder elected to purchase pursuant to Section 4.10(b) above multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number or amount of Offered Securities NGAS actually proposes to issue, sell or exchange (including Offered Securities to be issued or sold to the Holder pursuant to Section 4.10(c) above prior to such reduction) and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the original amount of the Offered Securities. In the event that the Holder so elects to reduce the number or amount of Offered Securities specified in its Notice of Acceptance, NGAS may not issue, sell or exchange more than the reduced number or amount of the Offered Securities unless and until such securities have again been offered to the Holder in accordance with Section 4.10(a) above. (e) Upon the closing of the issuance, sale or exchange of all or less than all of the Refused Securities, the Holder shall acquire from NGAS, and NGAS shall issue to the Holder, the number or amount of Offered Securities specified in the Holders Notice of Acceptance, as reduced pursuant to Section 4.10(c) above if the Holder has so elected, upon the terms and conditions specified in the Offer. The purchase by the Holder of any Offered Securities is subject in all cases to (i) the preparation, execution and delivery by NGAS and the Holder of a purchase agreement relating to such Offered Securities reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder and its respective counsel (the Subsequent Placement Agreement), (ii) the Holders satisfaction, in its sole discretion, with the final terms and/or conditions that differ from those contained in the Offer Notice, and (iii) the Holders reasonable satisfaction with the identity of the other Persons to which the Offered Securities will be sold. (f) Any Offered Securities not acquired by the Holder or other Persons in accordance with this Section 4.10 may not be issued, sold or exchanged until they are again offered to the Holder under the procedures specified in this Agreement. (g) NGAS and the Holder agree that if the Holder elects to participate in the Offer, without the written consent of the Holder, neither the Subsequent Placement Agreement with respect to such Offer nor any other transaction documents related thereto shall include any term or provision whereby the Holder shall be required to agree to any restrictions on trading as to any securities of NGAS with respect to any period after the public announcement of such Subsequent Placement beyond those restrictions on the transfer or sale of the securities purchased in such Subsequent Placement agreed to by other purchasers in such Subsequent Placement or be required to consent to any amendment to or termination of, or grant any waiver or release under or in connection with, any agreement previously entered into with NGAS or any instrument received from NGAS. (h) The restrictions contained in this Section 4.10 shall not apply (1) in connection with the issuance of any Excluded Securities (as defined below) and (2) to the extent that in the written opinion of counsel to NGAS (which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holder) with respect to a Subsequent Placement of Offered Securities that are not being issued pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act, the exercising of the participation right would result in NGAS not being able to offer or sell the Offered Securities pursuant to any exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Excluded Securities means, collectively, (i) Common Shares issued (including upon 11 exercise of standard options to purchase Common Shares) to directors, officers or employees of NGAS in their capacity as such pursuant to an Approved Share Plan, provided that (1) all such issuances (taking into account the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such options) after the date hereof pursuant to this clause (A) do not, in the aggregate, exceed more than 5% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the date hereof and (2) such options are not amended to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder or to lower the exercise price thereof or to otherwise materially change the terms or conditions thereof in any manner that adversely affects the Holder, (ii) the 2009 Conversion Shares, (iii) the 2009 Warrant Shares, (iv) the 2009 Exchange Shares, and (v) Common Shares issued pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment underwritten public offering with a nationally recognized underwriter which generates gross proceeds to NGAS in excess of $25,000,000 (but expressly excluding at-the-market offerings (as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act) and equity lines). 4.11 Shareholder Approval. NGAS shall provide each shareholder entitled to vote at a special or annual meeting of shareholders of NGAS (the Shareholder Meeting), which shall be promptly called and held not later than June 30, 2010 (the Shareholder Meeting Deadline), a proxy statement, substantially in the form which has been previously reviewed by the Holder and a counsel of its choice, soliciting each such shareholders affirmative vote at the Shareholder Meeting for approval of resolutions providing for NGASs issuance of all of the Securities as described in the Exchange Documents in accordance with applicable law and the rules and regulations of the Principal Market (such affirmative approval being referred to herein as the Shareholder Approval), and NGAS shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders approval of such resolutions (which best efforts shall include, without limitation, the requirement to hire a reputable proxy solicitor) and to cause the Board of Directors of NGAS to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such resolutions. NGAS shall be obligated to seek to obtain the Shareholder Approval by the Shareholder Meeting Deadline. If, despite NGASs best efforts the Shareholder Approval is not obtained on or prior to the Shareholder Meeting Deadline, NGAS shall cause two additional Shareholder Meetings to be held each calendar year thereafter until such Shareholder Approval is obtained. NGAS shall reimburse the Holder for the fees and disbursements of its legal counsel in connection with review of the above mentioned proxy statement(s), which amount shall be limited to $15,000. 4.12 Holding Period. For the purposes of Rule 144, NGAS acknowledges that the holding period of the 2009 Conversion Shares, the 2009 Warrant Shares (if acquired using a Cashless Exercise (as defined in the 2009 Warrant)) and the 2009 Exchange Shares may be tacked onto the holding period of the Old Note, and NGAS agrees not to take a position contrary to this Section 4.12. NGAS agrees to take all actions, including, without limitation, the issuance by its legal counsel of any necessary legal opinions, necessary to issue the 2009 Conversion Shares, the 2009 Warrant Shares (if acquired using a Cashless Exercise (as defined in the 2009 Warrant)) and the 2009 Exchange Shares that are freely tradable on the Principal Market without restriction and not containing any restrictive legend without the need for any action by the Holder. 4.13 Pledge of Securities. NGAS acknowledges and agrees that the Securities may be pledged by the Holder in connection with a bona fide margin agreement or other loan or financing arrangement that is secured by the Securities. The pledge of Securities shall not be deemed to be a transfer, sale or assignment of the Securities hereunder, and if the Holder effects a pledge of Securities it shall not be required to provide NGAS with any notice thereof or otherwise make any delivery to NGAS pursuant to this Agreement or any other Exchange Document. NGAS hereby agrees to execute and deliver such documentation as a pledgee of the Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge of the Securities to such pledgee by the Holder. 4.14 Restriction on Redemption and Dividends. So long as any 2009 Notes or 2009 Warrants are outstanding, NGAS shall not, directly or indirectly, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire for value or declare or pay any dividend or distribution on, any share capital of the Company without the prior express written consent of the holders of 2009 Notes representing not less than a majority of the then outstanding 2009 Notes unless, solely with respect to an issuance of non-convertible preferred shares of the Company after the Closing Date, (i) concurrently with the issuance of such non-convertible preferred shares, a portion of the proceeds of such issuance greater than or equal to the aggregate cash dividends payable under such non-convertible preferred shares during the period commencing on such issuance date and ending on the Maturity Date (as defined in the 2009 Notes) shall be deposited by the Company (or the purchasers of such securities) into an escrow account with BNY Mellon or such other similar FDIC insured financial institution (such portion of the proceeds of such issuance so deposited in the escrow account, the Escrow Property), (ii) the Company does not pay or otherwise distribute to any holder of non-convertible preferred shares any cash dividends or other distributions with respect to such non-convertible 12 preferred shares except from the Escrow Property held in such escrow account, and (iii) so long as such non-convertible preferred shares remain outstanding, the Company does not release any of the Escrow Property from such escrow account except (A) to the extent permitted by clause (ii) above or (B) on any given date to the extent of the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of cash in such escrow account as of such date and (y) the amount of dividends payable pursuant to the non-convertible preferred shares then outstanding during the period commencing on such given date and ending on the Maturity Date. 4.15 Additional Notes; Variable Securities. So long as the Holder beneficially owns any Securities, NGAS will not issue any 2009 Notes (other than as contemplated hereby and by the Other Exchange Agreements) and NGAS shall not issue any other securities that would cause a breach or default under the 2009 Notes. For so long as any 2009 Notes or 2009 Warrants remain outstanding, NGAS shall not, in any manner, issue or sell any rights, warrants or options to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or directly or indirectly convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common Shares at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the Common Shares, including by way of one or more reset(s) to any fixed price unless the conversion, exchange or exercise price of any such security cannot be less than the then applicable Conversion Price (as defined in the 2009 Notes) with respect to the Common Shares into which any 2009 Note is convertible or the then applicable Exercise Price (as defined in the 2009 Warrants) with respect to the Common Shares into which any 2009 Warrant is exercisable. 4.16 Corporate Existence. So long as the Holder beneficially owns any Securities, NGAS shall not be party to any Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the 2009 Notes) unless the Company is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the 2009 Notes and the 2009 Warrants. 4.17 Conduct of Business. The business of NGAS and its Subsidiaries shall not be conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any governmental entity, except where such violations would not result, either individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. 4.18 Form D and Blue Sky. The Company shall make all filings and reports relating to the Exchange required under applicable securities or Blue Sky laws of the states of the United States following the Closing Date, if any. 4.19 Register. NGAS shall maintain at its principal executive offices (or such other office or agency of NGAS as it may designate by notice to each holder of Securities), a register for the 2009 Notes and the 2009 Warrants in which NGAS shall record the name and address of the Person in whose name the 2009 Notes and the 2009 Warrants have been issued (including the name and address of each transferee), the principal amount of the 2009 Notes held by such Person, the number of 2009 Conversion Shares issuable upon conversion of the 2009 Notes and the number of 2009 Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the 2009 Warrants held by such Person. NGAS shall keep the register open and available at all times during business hours for inspection of the Holder or its legal representatives. 4.20 Transfer Agent Instructions. NGAS shall issue irrevocable instructions to its transfer agent, and any subsequent transfer agent, to issue certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at The Depository Trust Company (DTC), registered in the name of the Holder or its respective nominee(s), for the Conversion Shares, the Warrant Shares and the 2005 Warrant Shares issued upon conversion of the 2009 Notes or exercise of the 2009 Warrants and the 2009 Exchange Shares in such amounts as specified from time to time by the Holder to NGAS upon conversion of the 2009 Notes or exercise of the 2009 Warrants in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions). NGAS warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this Section 4.20, and stop transfer instructions to give effect to Section 3.8 hereof, will be given by NGAS to its transfer agent, and that the Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable (assuming a Cashless Exercise of any 2009 Warrants) on the books and records of NGAS as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Exchange Documents. If the Holder effects a sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities in accordance with Section 3.8, NGAS shall permit the transfer and NGAS shall promptly instruct its transfer agent to issue one or more certificates or credit shares to the applicable balance accounts at DTC in such name and in such denominations as specified by the Holder to effect such sale, transfer or assignment. In the event that such sale, assignment or transfer involves 2009 Conversion Shares, 2009 Warrant Shares or 2009 Exchange Shares sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144, 13 the transfer agent shall issue such Securities to the Holder, assignee or transferee, as the case may be, without any restrictive legend. NGAS acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder. Accordingly, NGAS acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Section 4.20 will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by NGAS of the provisions of this Section 4.20, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an order and/or injunction restraining any breach and requiring immediate issuance and transfer, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. 4.21 Legends. NGAS and the Holder acknowledge and agree that the certificates or other instruments representing the 2009 Notes, 2009 Exchange Shares, 2009 Warrant and the 2009 Warrant Shares (assuming a Cashless Exercise of such 2009 Warrants) shall not bear any restrictive legend. Any 2009 Warrant Shares that are issued by NGAS other than pursuant to a Cashless Exercise of a 2009 Warrant, except as set forth below, shall bear any legend as required by the blue sky laws of any state and a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such share certificates): THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT.

The Holder agrees that it shall not vote any of its Holder Exchange Shares, Holder Warrant Shares or Holder Conversion Shares in connection with the Shareholder Approval. The Holder further agrees that it shall not sell, assign or transfer any interest in its Holder Exchange Shares, Holder Warrant Shares or Holder Conversion Shares unless the transferee of such shares agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 4.22; provided, however, that if such shares are transferred in a transaction effected over a national or international securities exchange, the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.22 shall no longer apply to the shares sold in such manner. 14", "section_full_title": "4.Covenants", "document_id": "1HhbGOz3uCFDOUtechJs3X.", "section_title": "Covenants"}, {"text": " 5.1 Conditions to the Obligations of the Holder.

This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law or choice of law. 7.2 Further Assurances; Additional Documents. The parties shall take any actions and execute any other documents that may be necessary or desirable to the implementation and consummation of this Agreement upon the reasonable request of the other party. 7.3 Fees and Expenses. Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement; provided, that NGAS shall reimburse the Holder for an aggregate of up to $75,000 of their reasonable documented out-of-pocket legal expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount shall be paid by NGAS by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing or upon termination of this Agreement so long as such termination did not occur as a result of a material breach by the Holder of any of its obligations hereunder (as the case may be). NGAS shall be responsible for the payment of any placement agents fees, financial advisory fees, or brokers commissions (other than for Persons engaged by the Holder) relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby. NGAS shall pay, and hold the Holder harmless against, any liability, loss or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and out-of-pocket expenses) arising in connection with any claim relating to any such payment. 7.4 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree on a modification of this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Exchange Document (and without implication that the following is required or applicable), it is the intention of the parties that in no event shall amounts and value paid by NGAS, or payable to or received by the Holder, under the Exchange Documents, including without limitation, any amounts that would be characterized as interest under applicable law (including, without limitation, any applicable Canadian or British Columbia law), exceed amounts permitted under any such applicable law. Accordingly, if any obligation to pay, payment made to the Holder, or collection by the Holder pursuant the Exchange Documents is finally judicially determined to be contrary to any such applicable law, such obligation to pay, payment or collection shall be deemed to have been made by mutual mistake of the Holder and NGAS and such amount shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by the applicable law. Such adjustment shall be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing or refunding, at the option of the Holder, the amount of interest or any other amounts which would constitute unlawful amounts required to be paid or actually paid to the Holder under the Exchange Documents. For greater certainty, to the extent that any interest, charges, fees, expenses or other amounts required to be paid to or received by the Holder under any of the Exchange Documents or related thereto are held to be within the meaning of interest or another applicable term to otherwise be violative of applicable law, such amounts shall be pro-rated over the period of time to which they relate. 7.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Exchange Documents represent the entire agreement and understandings between the parties concerning the Exchange and the other matters described herein and therein and supersedes and replaces any and all prior agreements and understandings solely with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, except as expressly set forth in the immediately following sentence, nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Exchange Document shall (or shall be deemed to) (i) have any effect on any agreements the Holder has entered into with NGAS or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof with respect to any prior investment made by the Holder in NGAS or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) waive, alter, modify or amend in any respect any obligations of NAGS or any of its Subsidiaries, or any rights of or benefits to the Holder or any other Person, in any agreement entered into prior to the date hereof between or among NGAS and/or any of its Subsidiaries and the Holder and all such agreements shall continue in full force and effect. Sections 4(c), 4(f), 4(j), 4(k) and 4(o) of the Securities Purchase Agreement are superseded in their entirety by Sections 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.14 and 4.15 of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, NGAS confirms that the 17 Holder has made not any commitment or promise or has any other obligation to provide any financing to NGAS, any Subsidiary or otherwise. 7.6 No Oral Modification. This Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by NGAS and by the Holder. All waivers relating to any provision of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the waiving party. 7.7 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given at the time of receipt if delivered by hand, by reputable overnight courier or by facsimile transmission (with receipt of successful and full transmission) to the applicable parties hereto at the address stated on the signature pages hereto or if any party shall have designated a different address or facsimile number by notice to the other party given as provided above, then to the last address or facsimile number so designated. 7.8 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the state of New York or any New York state court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the other Exchange Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, any of the other Exchange Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in the state of New York. The Company hereby appoints C T Corporation System, 4169 Westport Road, Louisville, KY 40207 as its agent for service of process in the United States. If service of process is effected pursuant to the above sentence, such service will be deemed sufficient under New York law and the Company shall not assert otherwise. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law. 7.9 EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER EXCHANGE DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 7.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by an e-mail which contains a portable document format (.pdf) file of an executed signature page, such signature page shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such signature page were an original thereof. 7.11 Headings; Gender. The headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Agreement. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, each pronoun herein shall be deemed to include the masculine, feminine, neuter, singular and plural forms thereof. The terms including, includes, include and words of like import shall be construed broadly as if followed by the words without limitation. The terms herein, hereunder, hereof and words of like import refer to this entire Agreement instead of just the provision in which they are found. For purposes of this Agreement for the Holders benefit, the word state or states includes any province or provinces in Canada and the concept of law, rules or regulations includes laws, rules and regulations under applicable law, rules and regulations in Canada. 7.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person, other than the Indemnitees referred to in Section 7.14. 7.13 Survival; No Strict Construction. Unless this Agreement is terminated under Section 6 in accordance with the terms thereof, the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants shall survive the Closing. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party. 18 7.14 Indemnification. (a) In consideration of the Holders execution and delivery of the Exchange Documents to which it is a party and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of NGASs other obligations under the Exchange Documents, NGAS shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Holder and each affiliate of the Holder that holds any Securities and all of their shareholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Persons agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the Indemnitees) from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements (the Indemnified Liabilities), incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by NGAS in any of the Exchange Documents, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of NGAS contained in any of the Exchange Documents or (c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf of NGAS) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of any of the Exchange Documents, (ii) any disclosure properly made by the Holder pursuant to Section 4.3 or (iii) the status of the Holder or holder of the Securities as a holder of securities of NGAS pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents, except, with respect to clause (c) above, to the extent (but only to the extent) such Indemnified Liability arises from the Holders bad faith or willful misconduct. To the extent that the foregoing undertaking by NGAS may be unenforceable for any reason, NGAS shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. (b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee under this Section 7.14 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving an Indemnified Liability, such Indemnitee shall, if an Indemnified Liability in respect thereof is to be made against NGAS under this Section 7.14, deliver to NGAS a written notice of the commencement thereof, and NGAS shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent NGAS so desires, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to NGAS and the Indemnitee; provided, however, that an Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for such Indemnitee to be paid by NGAS, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by NGAS, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnitee and NGAS would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnitee and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. In the case of an Indemnitee, legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Indemnitees holding a majority of the then outstanding 2009 Notes. The Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with NGAS in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such Indemnified Liability by NGAS and shall furnish to NGAS all information reasonably available to the Indemnitee which relates to such Indemnified Liability. NGAS shall keep the Indemnitee reasonably apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. NGAS shall not be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that NGAS shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent. NGAS shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect to such Indemnified Liability. Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, NGAS shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made. The failure to deliver written notice to NGAS within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve NGAS of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 7.14, except to the extent that NGAS is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action. (c) The indemnification required by this Section 7.14 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Liabilities are incurred. (d) The indemnification required by this Section 7.14 shall be in addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnitee against NGAS or others, and (ii) any liabilities NGAS may be subject to pursuant to the law. 19 7.15 Remedies. The Holder and each affiliate of the Holder that holds any Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Exchange Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such holders have under any law. Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law. Furthermore, NGAS recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its obligations under any of the Exchange Documents, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Holder. NGAS therefore agrees that the Holder shall be entitled to seek specific performance and/or temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in any such case without the necessity of proving damages and without posting a bond or other security. 7.16 Withdrawal Right. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) the Exchange Documents, whenever the Holder exercises a right, election, demand or option under an Exchange Document and NGAS does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then the Holder may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to NGAS, any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights. 7.17 Payment Set Aside. To the extent that NGAS makes a payment or payments to the Holder hereunder or the Holder enforces or exercises its rights hereunder or thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to NGAS, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, foreign, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, all dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement and the other Exchange Documents are in United States Dollars (US Dollars), and all amounts owing under this Agreement and all other Exchange Documents shall be paid in US Dollars. All amounts denominated in other currencies shall be converted in the US Dollar equivalent amount in accordance with the Exchange Rate on the date of calculation. Exchange Rate means, in relation to any amount of currency to be converted into US Dollars pursuant to this Agreement, the US Dollar exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the relevant date of calculation. 7.18 Independent Nature of the Holders Obligations and Rights. The obligations of the Holder under the Exchange Documents are several and not joint with the obligations of any Other Note Holder under the Other Exchange Documents, and the Holder shall not be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any Other Note Holders under any Other Exchange Documents. Nothing contained herein or in any other Exchange Document, and no action taken by the Holder pursuant hereto or any Other Note Holder pursuant to any Other Exchange Documents, shall be deemed to constitute the Holder or any Other Note Holder as, and NGAS acknowledges that the Holder and the Other Note Holders do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Holder and any Other Note Holder are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents, the Other Exchange Documents or any matters, and NGAS acknowledges that the Holder and the Other Note Holders are not acting in concert or as a group or entity, and NGAS shall not assert any such claim, with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents and the Other Exchange Documents. The decision of the Holder to acquire the Securities pursuant to the Exchange Documents has been made by the Holder independently of any Other Note Holder. The Holder acknowledges that no Other Note Holder has acted as agent for the Holder in connection with the Holder making its acquisition hereunder and that no Other Note Holder will be acting as agent of the Holder in connection with monitoring the Holders Securities or enforcing its rights under the Exchange Documents. NGAS and the Holder confirm that the Holder has independently participated with NGAS in the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors. The Holder shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any of the other Exchange Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any Other Note Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. To the extent that any of the Other Note Holders and NGAS enter into the same or similar documents, all such matters are solely in the control of NGAS, not the action or decision of the Holder, and 20 would be solely for the convenience of NGAS and not because it was required or requested to do so by the Holder or any Other Note Holder. For clarification purposes only and without implication that the contrary would otherwise be true, the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents include only the transaction between NGAS and the Holder and do not include any other transaction between NGAS and any Other Note Holder. 7.19 Reaffirmation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the second sentence of Section 7.5, (i) the Securities Purchase Agreement and each other Transaction Document is, and shall continue to be, in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects, except that on and after the Closing Date (A) all references in the Securities Purchase Agreement to the Securities Purchase Agreement, hereto, hereof, this Agreement, hereunder or words of like import referring to the Securities Purchase Agreement shall mean the Securities Purchase Agreement as amended by this Agreement and the Other Exchange Agreements and (B) all references in the other Transaction Documents to the Securities Purchase Agreement, thereto, thereof, thereunder or words of like import referring to the Securities Purchase Agreement shall mean the Securities Purchase Agreement as amended by this Agreement and the Other Exchange Agreements, and (ii) the execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not operate as an amendment or waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Holder under any Transaction Document, nor constitute an amendment or waiver of any provision of any Transaction Document and all of them shall continue in full force and effect, as amended or modified by this Agreement and the Other Exchange Agreements. 7.20 Most Favored Nation. NGAS hereby represents and warrants as of the date hereof and covenants and agrees from and after the date hereof that, except as set forth in the term sheet attached hereto as Exhibit G, none of the terms offered to any Person with respect to any consent, release, amendment, settlement or waiver relating to the terms, conditions and transactions contemplated hereby (each a Settlement Document), is or will be more favorable to such Person than those of the Holder and this Agreement. If, and whenever on or after the date hereof, NGAS enters into a Settlement Document, then (i) NGAS shall provide notice thereof to the Holder immediately following the occurrence thereof and (ii) the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the other Exchange Documents and the Securities (other than any limitations on conversion or exercise set forth therein) shall be, without any further action by the Holder or NGAS, automatically amended and modified in an economically and legally equivalent manner such that the Holder shall receive the benefit of the more favorable terms and/or conditions (as the case may be), provided that upon written notice to NGAS at any time the Holder may elect not to accept the benefit of any such amended or modified term or condition, in which event the term or condition contained in this Agreement or the Securities (as the case may be) shall apply to the Holder as it was in effect immediately prior to such amendment or modification as if such amendment or modification never occurred with respect to the Holder. The provisions of this Section 7.20 shall apply similarly and equally to each Settlement Document. 7.21 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any purchasers of any of the Holder Note or the Holder Warrant, but not to any transferee of any Exchange Shares, 2009 Conversion Shares or 2009 Warrant Shares. NGAS shall not assign this Agreement, the other Exchange Documents or any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Holder, including, without limitation, by way of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the 2009 Notes) (unless NGAS is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the 2009 Warrants and the 2005 Warrant and the 2009 Warrants). The Holder may assign some or all of its rights hereunder in connection with transfer of any of its Securities without the consent of NGAS, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to be a Holder hereunder with respect to such assigned rights. 7.22 Judgment Currency. (a) If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any court in any jurisdiction it becomes necessary to convert into any other currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this Section 7.22 referred to as the Judgment Currency) an amount due in U.S. dollars under this Agreement, the conversion shall be made at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the Trading Day immediately preceding: 21 (i) the date actual payment of the amount due, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of New York or in the courts of any other jurisdiction that will give effect to such conversion being made on such date: or (ii) the date on which the foreign court determines, in the case of any proceeding in the courts of any other jurisdiction (the date as of which such conversion is made pursuant to this Section 7.22(a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to as the Judgment Conversion Date). (b) If in the case of any proceeding in the court of any jurisdiction referred to in Section 7.22(a)(ii) above, there is a change in the Exchange Rate prevailing between the Judgment Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the applicable party shall pay such adjusted amount as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when converted at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of U.S. dollars which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated in the judgment or judicial order at the Exchange Rate prevailing on the Judgment Conversion Date.

SECTION 1.03 Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. 8 Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or Opinion of Counsel, or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel or representation by counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Issuer stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Issuer, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous. Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. SECTION 1.04 Acts of Holders (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing or by the record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of such Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Fifteen; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or any such record is delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer Such instrument or instruments or such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the Act of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments or voting at such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer if made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 15.07 and the record so proved shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section. (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or may be proved in such other manner as shall be deemed sufficient by the Trustee Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. (c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security. (e) The Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, may set a date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Securities entitled to consent, vote or take any other action referred to in this Section 1. 9 SECTION 1.05 Notices, etc to Trustee and Issuer. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of the Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office and, unless otherwise herein expressly provided, any such document shall be deemed to be sufficiently made, given, furnished or filed upon its receipt by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, or (2) the Issuer by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Issuer addressed to it at: [To be provided] or at any other address or addresses previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Issuer. SECTION 1.06 Notice to Holders; Waiver Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

SECTION 1.13 Legal Holidays In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities) payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on such Security need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no additional interest shall accrue with respect to the payment due on such date for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be. ARTICLE TWO SECURITY FORMS SECTION 2.01 Forms Generally The Securities of each series shall be in substantially the form established from time to time by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

Any endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee and in such manner as shall be specified in such Global Security. Any instructions by the Issuer with respect to a Global Security, after its initial issuance, shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 1.02. Global Securities may be issued in either temporary or permanent form. Permanent Global Securities will be issued in definitive form. ARTICLE THREE THE SECURITIES SECTION 3.01 Amount Unlimited; Issuable in Series The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.

All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution and set forth in such Officers Certificate or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time, and unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened for issuance of additional Securities of such series without the consent of the Holders thereof. Except as modified in a Board Resolution, Officers Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing a series of Securities, the Securities shall be subordinated in right of payment to Senior Indebtedness as provided in Article Four. The Securities of all series shall rank on a parity in right of payment. If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers Certificate setting forth the terms of the series. SECTION 3.02 Denominations The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 3.03 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Issuer shall bind such Person notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of issuance of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, together with an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Issuer Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 3.04, the notation of a beneficial owners interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owners interest in such permanent Global Security. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon the documents specified in Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act, and, in addition: (1) a Board Resolution relating thereto, and if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken pursuant to such Board Resolution, certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer, if applicable; (2) an executed supplemental indenture, if any; and 14 (3) an Opinion of Counsel which shall state: (A) that the form and terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolutions, by a supplemental indenture or by both such resolution or resolutions and such supplemental indenture in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (B) that the supplemental indenture, if any, when executed and delivered by the Issuer and the Trustee, will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the Issuer; and (C) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and to general equity principles, and will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Nothwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of this Section 3.03, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Board Resolution and the Officers Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the Board Resolution and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 3.03 at or prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series, if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 3.04 Temporary Securities Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Issuer may execute, and upon Issuer Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, reproduced or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Issuer will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series. 15 SECTION 3.05 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange Global Securities Representing the Securities (a) The Issuer shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the Security Register) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed Security Registrar for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity. Except as otherwise provided in this Article Three, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing with such signature guaranteed by a commercial bank reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or by a member of a national securities exchange. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 10.06 or 12.07 not involving any transfer. The Issuer shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 12.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange of any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. (b) If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 3.03 and the Issuer Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee or delivered or held pursuant to such Depositarys instruction, and (iv) unless otherwise provided for, the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 3.01, shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: This Security may not be 16 transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary, unless and until this Security is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form. Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01 must, at the time of its designation and at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and any other applicable statute or regulation. If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series shall no longer be a clearing agency registered and in good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation (as required by this Section 3.05), the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under this Section 3.05 with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. If the Securities of any series shall have been issued in the form of one or more Global Securities and if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Issuer may, and upon the request of the Trustee shall, promptly execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. The Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge: (i) to each Person specified by the Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Persons beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to the Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to holders thereof. Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or 17 otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. SECTION 3.06 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Issuer shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. SECTION 3.07 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. At the option of the Issuer, interest on the Securities of any series that bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register. Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (Defaulted Interest) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Issuer, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Issuer may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of 18 money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Issuer may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 3.08 Persons Deemed Owners Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. SECTION 3.09 Cancellation All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, conversion, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly shall be cancelled by it and, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Issuer may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered promptly shall be cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of in accordance with the Trustees customary procedures unless directed by an Issuer Order. The acquisition of any Securities by the Issuer shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented thereby unless and until such Securities are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. Permanent Global Securities shall not be destroyed until exchanged in full for definitive Securities or until payment thereon is made in full. 19", "section_full_title": "SECTION 1.02 Compliance Certificates and Opinions", "document_id": "1hXJjxSX608prxzJOC5HuO.", "section_title": "02 Compliance Certificates and Opinions"}, {"text": " Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year of twelve 30-day months. SECTION 3.11 CUSIP Numbers The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE FOUR SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES SECTION 4.01 Agreement To Subordinate The Issuer agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Security of any series agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Four, to the prior payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents of all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Securities shall in all respects rank pari passu with all other Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer; and only Indebtedness of the Issuer that is Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Four shall be subject to Section 4.12. SECTION 4.02 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy Upon any distribution to creditors of the Issuer in a liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Issuers assets and liabilities, the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations shall be fully cash collateralized before the Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Securities, and until all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents, any distribution to which the Holders would be entitled shall be made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness (except that Holders may receive (i) shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to (a) Senior Indebtedness and (b) any securities issued in exchange for Senior Indebtedness and (ii) payments and other distributions made from the trusts described in Section 5.01). SECTION 4.03 Default on Senior Indebtedness The Issuer shall not make any payment upon or in respect of the Securities (except that Holders may receive (i) shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to (a) Senior Indebtedness and (b) any securities issued in exchange for Senior Indebtedness and (ii) payments and other distributions made from the trusts described in Section 5.01) until all Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents if (i) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or of unreimbursed amounts under drawn letters of credit or in respect of bankers acceptances or fees relating to letters of credit or bankers acceptances constituting, Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing beyond any 20 applicable period of grace in the indenture, agreement or other document governing such Designated Senior Indebtedness (a Payment Default) or (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness that permits holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods (a Non-Payment Default) and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a Payment Blockage Notice) from a representative of holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness. Payments on the Securities, including any missed payments, may and shall be resumed (a) in the case of a Payment Default, upon the date on which such default is cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist or such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have been discharged or paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations shall have been fully cash collateralized and (b) in case of a Non-Payment Default, the earlier of (x) the date on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived, (y) 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received (each such period, the Payment Blockage Period) or (z) the date such Payment Blockage Period shall be terminated by written notice to the Trustee from the requisite holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness necessary to terminate such period or from their representative. No new Payment Blockage Period may be commenced unless and until 365 days have elapsed since the effectiveness of the immediately preceding Payment Blockage Notice. However, if any Payment Blockage Notice within such 365-day period is given by or on behalf of any holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness (other than the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities), the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Payment Blockage Notice within such period. In no event, however, shall the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any 365 consecutive day period. No Non-Payment Default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 days. SECTION 4.04 Acceleration of Payment of Securities If payment of the Securities of any series is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Issuer or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness (or their Representative) of the acceleration. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness is outstanding, the Issuer shall not pay the Securities until five Business Days after such holders or the Representative of the Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, shall pay the Securities only if this Article Four otherwise permits payment at that time. SECTION 4.05 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article Four should not have been made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and pay it over to them as their interests may appear. SECTION 4.06 Subrogation After all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Four to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on such Senior Indebtedness. 21 SECTION 4.07 Relative Rights This Article Four defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer. Nothing in this Indenture shall: (1) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on and liquidated damages in respect of, the Securities in accordance with their terms; or (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders. SECTION 4.08 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Issuer No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Issuer or by its failure to comply with this Indenture. SECTION 4.09 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent Notwithstanding Section 4.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that payments may not be made under this Article Four. The Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer may give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer has a Representative, only the Representative may give the notice. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and the Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Four with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Seven shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Four shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07. SECTION 4.10 Distribution or Notice to Representative Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any). SECTION 4.11 Article Four Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in this Article Four shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default. Nothing in this Article Four shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Securities. SECTION 4.12 Trust Moneys Not Subordinated Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of Government Securities held in trust under Article Five by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Four, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Issuer or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other creditor of the Issuer. 22 SECTION 4.13 Trustee Entitled to Rely Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Four, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (i) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 4.02 are pending, (ii) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (iii) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Four. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Four, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Four, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.03 shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Four. SECTION 4.14 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination Each Holder by accepting a Security of any series authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer as provided in this Article Four and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. SECTION 4.15 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Issuer or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Four or otherwise. SECTION 4.16 Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions (a) Each Holder by accepting a Security of any series acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness (b) Without in any way limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this Section, the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Four or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (1) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of Senior 23 Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Issuer or any other Person. SECTION 4.17 Trustees Compensation Not Prejudiced Nothing in this Article Four shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other sections of this Indenture. SECTION 4.18 Defeasance The terms of this Article Four shall not apply to payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Securities held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities pursuant to the provisions described in Section 5.03. ARTICLE FIVE SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE; DEFEASANCE SECTION 5.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Securities of any Series The Issuer shall be deemed to have satisfied and discharged the entire Indebtedness on all the Securities of any particular series (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, upon Issuer Request and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute such instruments as may be requested by the Issuer acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of such Indebtedness, when (a) either (1) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 11.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (2) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (A) have become due and payable, or (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer, in the case of (A), (B) or (C) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (other than Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06), for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Issuer; and (c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the entire Indebtedness on all Securities of such series have been complied with. 24 Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Issuer to the Trustee under Section 7.07 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (2) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 5.03 and the last paragraph of Section 11.03 shall survive. SECTION 5.02 Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance The Issuer may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a supplemental indenture or, at any time, by a Board Resolution set forth in an Officers Certificate with respect to the Securities of any series, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a particular series of Securities, elect to have either Section 5.03 or 5.04 be applied to all of the Outstanding Securities of that series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article Five. SECTION 5.03 Legal Defeasance and Discharge Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 5.02 of the option applicable to this Section 5.03, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all Outstanding Securities of the particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, Legal Defeasance). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the obligations relating to the Outstanding Securities of that series, including any coupons appertaining thereto, and the Securities of that series, including any coupons appertaining thereto, shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding only for the purposes of Section 5.06 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 5.03, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the Issuers obligations with respect to Securities of such series under Sections 3.05, 3.06, 11.02 and 11.03, (ii) rights of Holders to receive payments of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities of such series as they shall become due from time to time and other rights, duties and obligations of Holders as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts so deposited with the Trustee, (iii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder (for which purposes the Securities of such series shall be deemed outstanding), (iv) this Article Five and the obligations set forth in Section 5.06 hereof and (v) the obligations of the Issuer under Section 7.07 hereof. Subject to compliance with this Article Five, the Issuer may exercise its option under Section 5.03 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 5.04 with respect to the Securities of a particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto. SECTION 5.04 Covenant Defeasance Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 5.02 of the option applicable to this Section 5.04, the Issuer shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 9.01, 11.04, 11.05, 11.06, 11.08 and 11.09 hereof or established pursuant to Sections 3.01 or 10.01 hereof with respect to the Outstanding Securities of the particular series on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, Covenant Defeasance), and the Securities of that series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed not Outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed Outstanding for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of that series and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by 25 reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or Event of Default under Section 6.01(4) or any Event of Default specified pursuant to Section 3.01 or 10.01 but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be unaffected thereby. SECTION 5.05 Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 5.03 or Section 5.04 to the Outstanding Securities of a particular series: (a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee for the Securities of that series, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that series, cash in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of that series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of that series), U.

SECTION 5.06 Survival of Certain Obligations Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of the Securities of a particular series referred to in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.04, or 5.05, the respective obligations of the Issuer and the Trustee for the Securities of a particular series under Sections 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 3.09, 5.07, 5.08, 5.09 and 6.08, Article Seven, and Sections 8.01, 8.02, 11.02, 11.03 and 11.04, shall survive with respect to Securities of that series until the Securities of that series are no longer outstanding, and thereafter the obligations of the Issuer and the Trustee for the Securities of a particular series with respect to that series under Sections 5.07, 5.08 and 5.09 shall survive.

SECTION 5.08 Repayment of Moneys Held by Paying Agent Any money deposited with the Trustee or any other Paying Agent remaining unclaimed by the Holders of any Securities for two years after the date upon which the principal of or interest on such Securities shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Issuer by the Trustee or any such other Paying Agent and such Holders shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Issuer only as general creditors for payment thereof (unless otherwise provided by law); provided, however, that, before the Trustee or any such other Paying Agent is required to make any such payment to the Issuer, the Trustee may, upon the written request of the Issuer and at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be published once in an Authorized Newspaper a notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after the date set forth in said notice, the balance of such money then unclaimed will be returned to the Issuer. SECTION 5.09 Reinstatement If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuers obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Sections 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be; provided that, if the Issuer has made payment of principal of, or interest on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee. 27 ARTICLE SIX REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND HOLDERS ON EVENT OF DEFAULT SECTION 6.01 Events of Default Event of Default, wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of interest upon any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (whether or not such default shall be by reason of the operation of the provisions of Article Four);

or (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. SECTION 6.02 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than of a type specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6)) occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in any of the Securities of such series to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of such series shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Four. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (1) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7. and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.13. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under Section 6.01(5) or (6), all outstanding Securities shall IPSO FACTO become due and payable without further action or notice. 29 SECTION 6.03 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee The Issuer covenants that if (1) default is made in the payment of interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or, premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or (3) default is made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation when the same becomes due pursuant to the terms of any Security, the Issuer, upon demand of the Trustee, will pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, including any sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. If the Issuer fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Issuer or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 6.04 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Issuer or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents and take such other actions, including participating as a member, voting or otherwise, of any official committee of creditors appointed in such matter, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same; 30 and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding except as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person or to participate as a member, voting or otherwise, on any committee of creditors. SECTION 6.05 Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 6.06 Application of Money Collected Subject to the provisions of Article Four, any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07; SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively; and THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Issuer, its successors or assigns, or to whomever may be so lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. SECTION 6.07 Limitation on Suits No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; 31 (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders. SECTION 6.08 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment (subject to the provisions of Article Four) of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.09 Restoration of Rights and Remedies If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 6.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 6.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. SECTION 6.12 Control by Holders The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy 32 available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (2) the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of the Securities of such series not taking part in such direction, or to the Holders of the Securities of any other series, and (3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. SECTION 6.13 Waiver of Past Defaults Subject to Section 6.02, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Ten cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 6.14 Undertaking for Costs All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date). SECTION 6.15 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. 33 ARTICLE SEVEN THE TRUSTEE SECTION 7.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture but need not verify the accuracy of the contents thereof or whether procedures specified by or pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture have been followed in the preparation thereof. (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs. (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that (1) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, determined as provided in Section 6.12, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it; and (5) whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge with respect to one or more or all series of Securities hereunder or for any other reason, pay or by Issuer Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such series by the Issuer or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request subject to applicable abandoned property and escheat law, or (if then held by the Issuer) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published once a week for two consecutive weeks (in each case on any day of the week) in an Authorized Newspaper notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.

SECTION 11.06 Maintenance of Properties The Issuer will cause all its properties used or useful in the conduct of its business to be maintained and kept in reasonably good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Issuer may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Issuer from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Issuer desirable in the conduct of its business and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders of the Securities of any series. SECTION 11.07 Waiver of Certain Covenants The Issuer may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 11.04, 11.05 and 11.06 or established pursuant to Section 3.01 or 10.01, with respect to the Securities of any series, if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Issuer and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

For the purpose of this Section 11.08, compliance shall be determined without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice provided pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. 46 SECTION 11.09 Reports by Issuer The Issuer shall: (1) file with the Trustee, within 15 days after the Issuer is required to file the same with the Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Issuer may be required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or, if the Issuer is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to either of said Sections, then it shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of the supplementary and periodic information, documents and reports which may be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in respect of a security listed and registered on a national securities exchange as may be prescribed from time to time in such rules and regulations; (2) file with the Trustee and the Commission, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such additional information, documents and reports with respect to compliance by the Issuer with the conditions and covenants of this Indenture as may be required from time to time by such rules and regulations; and (3) transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, within 30 days after the filing thereof with the Trustee, such summaries of any information, documents and reports required to be filed by the Issuer pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Section as may be required by rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only the Trustees receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuers or the Parent Guarantors compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers Certificates). SECTION 11.10 Further Assurances From time to time whenever reasonably demanded by the Trustee, the Issuer will make, execute and deliver or cause to be made, executed and delivered any and all such further and other instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or facilitate the performance of the terms of this Indenture.

In case of any redemption at the election of the Issuer of less than all the Securities of any series, the Issuer shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Issuer (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal 47 amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. SECTION 12.03 Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 45 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series; provided, however, that Securities of such series registered in the name of the Issuer shall be excluded from any such selection for redemption until all Securities of such series not so registered shall have been previously selected for redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 12.04 Notice of Redemption Notice of redemption shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuers request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer. 48 SECTION 12.05 Deposit of Redemption Price On or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on any Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Issuer is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 11.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 12.06 Securities Payable on Redemption Date Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Issuer at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security. SECTION 12.07 Securities Redeemed in Part Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Issuer or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the security so surrendered. Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part, but only in whole multiples of $1,000. SECTION 12.08 Securities No Longer Outstanding After Notice to Trustee and Deposit of Cash If the Issuer, having given notice to the Trustee as provided in Section 12.02, shall have deposited with the Trustee or a Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of any Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption in whole or in part cash or other form of payment if permitted by the terms of such Securities (which amount shall be immediately due and payable to the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof), in the amount necessary so to redeem all such Securities or portions thereof on the Redemption Date and provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of notice of such redemption, such Securities or portions thereof, shall thereupon, for all purposes of this Indenture, be deemed to be no longer Outstanding, and the Holders thereof shall be entitled to no rights thereunder or hereunder, except the right to receive payment of the Redemption Price, together with interest accrued to the Redemption Date, on or after the Redemption Date of such Securities or portions thereof. 49 ARTICLE THIRTEEN SINKING FUNDS SECTION 13.01 Applicability of Article The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.

Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 13.03 Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund Not less than 45 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officers Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 13.02 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered.

SPS Commerce, Inc. Form of Director Indemnification Agreement [Independent Director] Page 3 (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 6(a) hereof, a determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the board: (1) by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a majority vote of the disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum, (3) if there are no disinterested directors or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee, or (4) if so directed by the Board of Directors, by the stockholders of the Company For purposes hereof, disinterested directors are those members of the board of directors of the Company who are not parties to the action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee. (c) If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 6(b) hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 6(c) The Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board of Directors and Indemnitee shall be promptly notified of such selection. Indemnitee may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 13 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Indemnitee to the Companys selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 6(b) hereof.

Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

Any Independent Counsel, member of the Board of Directors or stockholder of the Company shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding the Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom. (h) The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty In the event that any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. (i) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful SPS Commerce, Inc.

German Security means the assets the subject of a security document which is governed by German Law. Each Secured Creditor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to accept, as its representative (Stellvertreter), any German Security created in favor of such Secured Creditor. (c) Furthermore, each Secured Creditor hereby authorizes (bevollmaechtigt) the Collateral Agent (with the right of sub-delegation) to enter into any documents evidencing -193- German Security and to make and accept all declarations and take all actions as it considers necessary or useful in connection with any German Security on behalf of such Secured Creditor.

For greater certainty, by their acceptance of the benefits of the Canadian Security Agreement, each of the Other Creditors (as defined in the Canadian Security Agreement) shall be deemed to have confirmed and ratified the appointment of the Collateral Agent for purposes of the Bond and the Bond pledge agreement to be entered into by Dole Canada pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec.

To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless any Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender, any Bank Guaranty Issuer, the Intermediate Holdco Paying Agent, the Deposit Bank, or any Lender set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the Credit Agreement Parties hereby agree to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. 13.02 Right of Setoff (a) In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Agent, each Issuing Lender, each Bank Guaranty Issuer, each Lender and the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Agent, such Issuing Lender, Bank Guaranty Issuer, such Lender or the Collateral Agent (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of such Agent, such Issuing Lender, such Bank Guaranty Issuer, such Lender or the Collateral Agent wherever located) to or for the credit or the account of the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries against and on account of the Obligations and liabilities of the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, to such Agent, such Issuing Lender, such Bank Guaranty Issuer, such Lender or the Collateral Agent under this Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all interests in Obligations purchased by such Lender pursuant to Section 13.06(b), all participations by any Lender in Letters of Credit, Bank Guaranties as required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not such Agent, such Issuing Lender, such Bank Guaranty Issuer, such Lender or the Collateral Agent shall have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations shall be contingent or unmatured. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender purchasing participations in one or more Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties issued to it as required by the provisions of this Agreement, or purchasing participations as required by Section 13.06(b), may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights (including without limitation the right of setoff) with respect to such participations as fully as if such Lender is a direct creditor of such Borrower with respect to such participations in the amount thereof. (b) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING SUBSECTION (a), AT ANY TIME THAT THE LOANS OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION SHALL BE SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA, NO LENDER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL EXERCISE A RIGHT OF SETOFF, LIEN OR COUNTERCLAIM OR TAKE ANY COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR INSTITUTE ANY PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY NOTE UN- -197- LESS IT IS TAKEN WITH THE CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR APPROVED IN WRITING BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, IF SUCH SETOFF OR ACTION OR PROCEEDING WOULD OR MIGHT (PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 580a, 580b, 580d AND 726 OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OR SECTION 2924 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, IF APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE) AFFECT OR IMPAIR THE VALIDITY, PRIORITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIENS GRANTED TO THE COLLATERAL AGENT PURSUANT TO THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS OR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND ANY ATTEMPTED EXERCISE BY ANY LENDER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OF ANY SUCH RIGHT WITHOUT OBTAINING SUCH CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS SUBSECTION (b) SHALL BE SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EACH OF THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREUNDER. 13.03 Notices (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to any Credit Agreement Party, at the address specified opposite its signature below; if to any Lender, at its address specified for such Lender on Schedule II; and if to the Administrative Agent, at its Notice Office; or, as to any Credit Agreement Party or any of the Agents, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each Lender, at such other address as shall be designated by such Lender in a written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and communications shall be mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied or cabled or sent by overnight courier, and shall be effective when received. (b) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries to confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, any Agent, any Issuing Lender (in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit) or any Bank Guaranty Issuer (in the case of the issuance of a Bank Guaranty), as the case may be, may prior to receipt of written confirmation act without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by such Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Bank Guaranty Issuer in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer. In each such case, the U.S. Borrower and each of the Borrowers hereby waive the right to dispute such Agents, or such Issuing Lenders or such Bank Guaranty Issuers record of the terms of such telephonic notice. 13.04 Benefit of Agreement (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no Credit Agreement Party may assign or transfer any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder or under any other Credit Document without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders and, provided, further, that, although any Lender may (without the consent of any Credit Party) transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender shall remain a Lender for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any portion of its Commitments or Loans hereunder except as provided in Section 13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a Lender hereunder and, provided, further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participa- -198- tion under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except (I) to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note, Letter of Credit or Bank Guaranty (unless such Letter of Credit or Bank Guaranty is not extended beyond the CL Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post- default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the participants participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment or of a mandatory repayment of Loans shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participants participation is not increased as a result thereof and that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in any rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i), notwithstanding the fact that such amendment or modification actually results in such a reduction), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit Agreement Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in the Security Documents) supporting the Obligations in which such participant is participating and (II) that, solely in the case of a participant (each, a Voting Participant) which (x) has purchased a participation interest in such Lenders Commitments and/or outstanding Term Loans in a minimum aggregate amount (without duplication) of at least $2,000,000 on or after the Restatement Effective Date and (y) is (A) designated by such Lender to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent by written notice (a Voting Participant Notice) as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a voting participant hereunder, (B) approved by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (C) not a Disqualified Voting Participant, such participant shall be entitled to vote with respect to each Tranche in which it holds a participation from such Lender (and the voting rights of such Lender for each such Tranche shall be correspondingly reduced), on a Dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender under such Tranche on any matter requiring or allowing such Lender to provide or withhold its consent or to otherwise vote on any proposed action (with any Voting Participant Notice, with respect to any Voting Participant, to be effective only if same (a) states the full legal name of such Voting Participant, as well as the relevant contact information and administrative details for such Voting Participant, and (b) states the Dollar amount of the participation interest in each Tranche purchased). In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participants rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; provided that a Voting Participant shall have the voting rights to which it is entitled as described in the preceding sentence. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its outstanding Term Loans and/or Credit-Linked Commitments (and related outstanding Obligations (and Credit-Linked Deposit, if applicable) hereunder) to (i) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company, (ii) one or more Lenders or (iii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank -199- loans, any other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same investment advisor of a Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at least (A) $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such outstanding principal amount of Term Loans hereunder and (B) $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such Credit-Linked Commitments and related Credit-Linked Deposit and Obligations, in each case, to one or more Eligible Transferees (treating (I) any fund that in vests in bank loans and (II) any other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same investment advisor as such fund or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor, as a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i) at such time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the outstanding Term Loans and/or Credit-Linked Commitments, as the case may be, of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the request of the respective Lender and upon the surrender of the old Notes (if any), new Notes will be issued, at the Borrowers expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05 (with appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, (iii) except in the case of assignments by the Agents in connection with their syndication of this Agreement, the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and is continuing, the U.S. Borrower shall be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant to clause (y) of this Section 13.04(b) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv) Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and, provided, further, that such transfer or assignment will not be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to Section 13.17. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments (and, in the case of an assignment of Credit-Linked Commitments, will lose its rights with respect to the assigned CL Percentage in its Credit-Linked Deposit) and/or outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section 4.04(b)(ii) to the extent such forms would provide a complete exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax. To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lenders Commitments and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.13 or this Section 13.04(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 1.11, 2A.06, 2B.06, or 4.04 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (altho ugh the Borrowers, in accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, at any time after the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment, if any Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties remain outstanding, assignments may be made as provided above, except that the respective assignment shall be of a portion of the respective CL Lenders participation in Letters of Credit and Bank Guaranties (and -200- the related share of its Credit-Linked Deposit), although any such assignment effected after the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall not release the assigning CL Lender from its obligations as a participant with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties (although the respective assignee may agree, as between itself and the respective assigning CL Lender, that it shall be responsible for such amounts). The Credit-Linked Deposit funded by any CL Lender shall not be released in connection with any assignment of its Credit-Linked Commitment, but shall instead be purchased (to the extent of the CL Percentage so assigned) by the relevant assignee and continue to be held for application (if not already applied) pursuant to Section 2 in respect of such assignees obligations under the Credit-Linked Commitment assigned to it. (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or any Credit Agreement Party, any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee or to a collateral agent or to another creditor providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations to such trustee, such Collateral Agent or a holder of, or any other representative of a holder of, such obligations, or such other creditor, as the case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute (by foreclosure or otherwise) any such pledge or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. 13.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative No failure or delay on the part of any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between any Credit Party and any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 13.06 Payments Pro Rata (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of any Credit Party in respect of any Obligations of such Credit Party, it shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, distribute such payment to the Lenders (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive its pro rata share of such payment) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received. (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or bankers lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans, Unpaid Drawings or Fees, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or -201- sums received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Credit Party to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of the preceding Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders. 13.07 Calculations; Computations (a) The financial statements to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing by the U.S. Borrower to the Lenders), provided that (i) except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations determining the Excess Cash Flow, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio and compliance with Sections 4, 8.15 and 9, including in each case definitions used therein, shall, in each case, utilize United States accounting principles and policies in effect at the time of the preparation of, and in conformity with those used to prepare, the historical consolidated audited financial statements of the U.S. Borrower delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.10(b) for Fiscal Year 2004, (ii) to the extent expressly required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, certain calculations shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis and (iii) for purposes of determining compliance with any incurrence or expenditure tests set forth in Sections 8 and/or 9, any amounts so incurred or expended (to the extent incurred or expended in a currency other than Dollars) shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange rates (as shown on Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such exchange rates, on such other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) as in effect on the date of such incurrence or expenditure under any provision of any such Section that has an aggregate Dollar limitation provided for therein (and to the extent the respective incurrence or expenditure test regulates the aggregate amount outstanding at any time and it is expressed in terms of Dollars, all outstanding amounts originally incurred or spent in currencies other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange rates (as shown on Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such exchange rates, on such other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) as in effect on the date of any new incurrence or expenditures made under any provision of any such Section that regulates the Dollar amount outstanding at any time). (b) All computations of interest and Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or Fees are payable. 13.08 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL, EXCEPT AS OTH- -202- ERWISE PROVIDED IN CERTAIN OF THE SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTIES AND SECURITY DOCUMENTS, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent shall cease to be available to act as such, each Credit Agreement Party agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in New York City on the terms and for the purposes of this provision reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

The Administrative Agent will give each Credit Agreement Party and each Lender prompt written notice of the occurrence of the Restatement Effective Date. 13.11 Headings Descriptive The headings of the several sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. 13.12 Amendment or Waiver;

Each Credit Agreement Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that each Lender may share with any of its affiliates or its investment advisors any information related to the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any nonpublic customer information regarding the creditworthiness of such entities), provided that such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.15 to the same extent as such Lender and shall only use such information in connection with matters relating to this Agreement. (b) Each Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and acknowledges that, to the best of its knowledge, neither any Agent nor any Lender, nor any employees or agents of, or other persons affiliated with, any Agent or any Lender, have directly or indirectly made or provided any statement (oral or written) to such Credit Agreement Party or to any of its employees or agents, or other persons affiliated with or related to such Credit Agreement Party (or, so far as such Credit Agreement Party is aware, to any other person), as to the potential tax consequences of the Transaction. (c) Neither the Agents nor the Lenders provide accounting, tax or legal advice.

Nothing herein is intended to imply that any of each Credit Agreement Party, each Agent and each Lender made or provided a statement, oral or written, to, or for the benefit of, any of each other as to any potential tax consequences that are related to, or may result from, the Transaction. 13.16 Waiver of Jury Trial EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 13.17 Register The Borrowers hereby designate the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent agrees, to serve as the Borrowers agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.17, to maintain a register at one of its offices in New York, New York (the Register) on which it will record the Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Borrowers obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and/or Loans prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and/or Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of an assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and/or Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Commitment and/or Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note evidencing such Commitment and/or Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender. The registration of any provision of Incremental Term Loan Commitments pursuant to Section 1.15 shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance of the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement. Coincident with the delivery of such Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement for acceptance and registration -209- of the provision of an Incremental Term Loan Commitment, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to the extent requested by such Incremental Term Loan Lenders, Incremental Term Notes shall be issued, at the respective Borrowers expense, to such Incremental Term Loan Lenders, to be in conformity with Section 1.05 (with appropriate modification) to the extent needed to reflect the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and outstanding Incremental Term Loans made by such Incremental Term Loan Lender. The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature that may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 13.17. 13.18 English Language This Agreement and all other Credit Documents shall be in the English language, except as required by applicable local law and, with respect to each of the Security Documents governed by the laws of Italy or otherwise related to Collateral located in Italy, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require (in which event certified English translations thereof shall, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, be provided by the U.S. Borrower to the Administrative Agent). All documents, certificates, reports or notices to be delivered or communications to be given or made by any party hereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be in the English language or, if originally written in another language, shall, upon request of the Administrative Agent, be accompanied by an accurate English translation upon which the other parties hereto shall have the right to rely for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. 13.19 Special Provisions Regarding Pledges of Equity Interests in, and Promissory Notes Owed by, Persons Not Organized in Qualified Jurisdictions; Special Provisions Regarding Foreign Security Documents and Secured Hedge Counterparties (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions of the various Security Documents executed and delivered by the Credit Parties require that, among other things, all promissory notes executed by, and Equity Interests in, various Persons owned by the respective Credit Party (to the extent not constituting Excluded Collateral) be pledged, and delivered for pledge, pursuant to the Security Documents. The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that each Credit Party shall be required to take all actions under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Credit Party is organized to create and perfect all security interests granted pursuant to the various Security Documents and to take all actions under the laws of each Qualified Jurisdiction to perfect the security interests in the Equity Interests of, and promissory notes issued by, any Person organized under the laws of said jurisdictions (in each case, to the extent said Equity Interests or promissory notes are owned by any Credit Party and do not constitute Excluded Collateral). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent any Security Document requires or provides for the pledge of promissory notes issued by, or Equity Interests in, any Person organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than those specified in the immediately preceding sentence, it is acknowledged that, as of the Restatement Effective Date, no actions have been required to be taken to perfect, under local law of the jurisdiction of the Person who issued the respective promissory notes or whose Equity Interests are pledged, under the Security Documents. The Credit Agreement Parties hereby agree that, following any request by the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders to do so, each Credit Agreement Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take such actions (including, without limitation, the execution of Additional Security Documents, the making of any filings and the delivery of appropriate legal opinions) under the local law of any jurisdiction with respect to which such actions have not already been taken as are determined -210- by the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders to be necessary or desirable in order to fully perfect, preserve or protect the security interests granted pursuant to the various Security Documents under the laws of such jurisdictions. If requested to do so pursuant to this Section 13.19(a), all such actions shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.19(a) and Section 8.11 and within the time periods set forth therein. All conditions and repre sentations contained in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to effect the foregoing and so that same are not violated by reason of the failure to take actions under local law (but only with respect to Equity Interests in, and promissory notes issued by, Persons organized under laws of jurisdictions other than Qualified Jurisdictions) not required to be taken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.19(a), provided that to the extent any representation or warranty would not be true because the foregoing actions were not taken, the respective representation of warranties shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects at such time as the respective action is required to be taken in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.19(a) or pursuant to Section 8.11. (b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that certain Foreign Security Documents executed and delivered by the Credit Parties on or prior to the Restatement Effective Date secure, inter alia, obligations of any Lender (or any affiliate of a Lender) which is a counterparty to certain Interest Rate Protection Agreements and Other Hedging Agreements (as further provided in each such Foreign Security Document) and that it is the parties intent that each such Foreign Security Document shall be amended, as provided in Article III of the Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty Amendment and Acknowledgement, such that (after giving effect to such amendment) the foregoing secured counterparties shall be amended to include the Secured Hedge Counterparties.

Each Credit Agreement Party waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Credit Agreement Party hereunder except to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Credit Agreement Party waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Credit Agreement Party against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security. Each Credit Agreement Party waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Relevant Guaranteed Obligations.

In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, each U.S. Credit Agreement Party hereby waives: (i) all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to such U.S. Credit Agreement Party by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; (ii) all rights and defenses that such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have because the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from such U.S. Credit Agreement Party without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Credit Party, (1) the amount of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from such U.S. Credit Agreement Party even if the Guaranteed Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed any right such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have to collect from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have because the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and (iii) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed such U.S. Credit Agreement Partys rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Relevant Guaranteed Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise. -220- (d) Each Credit Agreement Party warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law. 14.09 Payments All payments made by a Credit Agreement Party pursuant to this Section 14 shall be made in the respective Applicable Currency in which the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are then due and payable (giving effect, in the circumstances contemplated by Section 1.14, to any conversion occurring pursuant thereto).

A notice of demand for redemption from the holders of B-shares shall mention the date of the first tranche of the redemption and this date cannot be earlier than i) three business days after the date the company receives such notice of demand for redemption, or [?] 2014 [Insert five year anniversary of First Closing].

If such determination is disputed by the Requisite A Holders, then the company shall engage an investment banking firm reasonably acceptable to the Requisite A Holders to determine the fair market value of an A-share, and such determination shall be final absent manifest error. A notice of demand for redemption from the holders of A-shares shall mention the date of the first tranche of the redemption and this date cannot be earlier than i) three business days after the date the company receives such notice of demand for redemption, or [?] 2014 [Insert five year anniversary of First Closing].

When calculating the deadlines set out herein, statutory notice periods according to law shall be added. In the event of any conflict, other than the ranking as mentioned in the first paragraph of this  17, between the demand of redemption from holders of A-shares and B-shares respectively, the rights of the latter shall prevail. 18 Holder mandated conversion of B-shares Each holder of B-shares may, at any time, by written notice to the company demand that the company redeem and convert some or all B-shares held by such holder into ordinary shares. The company shall have an obligation to initiate the redemption and conversion process within two business days following the date of receipt of notice as mentioned above. The conversion of B-shares into ordinary shares shall be effected by redeeming the B-shares being converted and a simultaneous issue by the company of a claim for payment for the shares. The amount of such claim for payment for each B-share shall be equal to NOK 10 plus all accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends on such share. Such claim shall immediately be converted into ordinary shares for its full amount, and the subscription price for such ordinary shares to be issued shall be the conversion price then in effect. The ordinary shares shall be issued through a private placement directed towards the holders of B-shares who have given notice of a demand for redemption and conversion. If the conversion price in effect is NOK 10, then at the election of the converting B-shareholder, each B-share shall be converted into one ordinary share, and the accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends on such share shall be payable to such B-shareholder in cash. If a conversion of B-shares hereunder would result in the issuance of a fractional ordinary share, then the number of ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number of ordinary shares and against that the holder of B-shares will pay the difference in cash to the company. Conversion of B-shares is subject to the company being able, according to applicable law, to make such distributions as the redemption entails in addition to the company being able to obtain required corporate resolutions. Conversion Price The initial conversion price related to any conversion of B-shares into ordinary shares according to this  18 shall be NOK 10 and shall be adjusted as follows (the Conversion Price): The Conversion Price shall be adjusted for share splits being made prior to the completion of the redemption and conversion. In the event that the company having issued new shares, or sells its own shares for a consideration being lower than the prevailing Conversion Price immediately prior to such issuance or sale (Discount Price), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted to an amount calculated by multiplying the Conversion Price by the following fraction: N0 + N1 N0 + N2 Where N0 represents the number of ordinary shares in the company immediately prior to the issuance of new (or the companys sale of own) ordinary shares at a Discount Price (without taking into account convertible instruments, shares or similar being convertible into ordinary shares); Where N1 represents the number of ordinary shares which would have been issued (or sold) for the total consideration the company receives (or shall receive) if the issuance (or sale) had been completed at a price per share equal to the Conversion Price applicable immediately prior to the issuance or sale. Where N2 represents the number of ordinary shares issued or sold at a Discount Price. Notwithstanding the above, the Conversion Price shall not be adjusted to a lower amount than the prevailing par value of the companys shares. If the company issues shares (or sells it own shares) for other consideration than cash, the value of the consideration shall be based on fair market value principles. 19 Automatic conversion of B-shares The Requisite B Holders may, at any time, by written notice to the company demand that the company redeems and converts all B-shares into ordinary shares.

(a)In the event that any legal proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or demand (Claim) shall be asserted by any person or entity in respect of which payment may be sought under Section 9. 1 hereof (regardless of the Basket referred to above), the indemnified party shall reasonably and promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within five (5) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim. If the indemnified party defends any Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party for the Expenses of defending such Claim upon submission of periodic bills.

The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. 30 (b)After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within 10 business days after the date of such notice.  (c)The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.  (d)With respect to amounts payable by IDEH hereunder to the Target hereunder, it is agreed that IDEH shall first be obligated to pay all amounts in cash, up to the cash value of the Ordinary Shares actually received by the Target pursuant to Article 3 of this Agreement.

Nothing contained in this Agreement constitutes a commitment to make additional or future loans or advances to Borrower except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. B. Security Interest. To secure the payment and performance of the Secured Debts, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a security interest in all of the Property. The Property is all of the collateral given as security for the Secured Debts and described in this Agreement and in the Second Lien Deed of Trust and includes all obligations that support the payment or performance of the Property. The foregoing security interest covering the Property remains in effect until terminated in writing by Lender, even if the Secured Debts are paid and Lender is no longer obligated to advance funds to Borrower under any loan or credit agreement. C. Duties Toward Property. (1) Protection of Secured Partys Interest. Borrower will defend the Property against all other claims. Borrower agrees to do whatever Lender requires to perfect and protect Lenders security interest covering the Property, including all actions necessary to maintain Lenders security interest covering the Property as a first lien security interest (except with respect to the Real Property). Borrower will maintain books, records and accounts pertaining to the Property and Borrowers business in general in a manner consistent with records normally kept concerning property like the Property and a business like Borrowers business, and Lender shall have the right to examine and make copies of Borrowers books, records and accounts pertaining to the Property at any reasonable time. Borrower will cause the preparation of any report or accounting pertaining to the Property reasonably requested by Lender from time to time. (2) Use, Location and Protection of the Property. Borrower will keep the Property in Borrowers possession and in good repair, where applicable. Borrower will use the Property only for commercial purposes.

Borrower, at Borrowers expense, will perform all reasonable acts necessary to preserve and protect the Property. Where applicable, Borrower will prepare the Property for market and, when the Property is ready for market, promptly notify Lender and follow any instructions Lender may have regarding holding, shipping, storing and marketing the Property. Borrower will keep the items of the Property over $50,000 at Borrowers Dallas address listed hereinabove, at Borrowers leased sites in Duluth, Georgia, at Borrowers manufacturing sites or at Borrowers other customary sites for storage of inventory, unless Lender agrees that the Property may be kept at another location. If any items of the Property worth over $50,000 are to be used in other Page 7 states or countries, Borrower will give Lender a list of such locations. The location of the Property is given to aid in the identification of the Property but does not in any way limit the scope of the security interest granted to Lender. Borrower will notify Lender in writing and obtain Lenders prior written consent to any change in location of any items of the Property worth over $50,000 to any additional location. Borrower will not use the Property in violation of any law. Borrower will notify Lender in writing prior to any change in Borrowers address, name, identity or structure.

Except for Purchase Money Financing, Borrower will not sell, offer to sell, lease or otherwise transfer or encumber items of the Property worth over $50,000 not in the ordinary course of business without Lenders prior written permission. Lenders permission to sell the Property may be reasonably withheld without regard to the creditworthiness of any buyer or transferee. Borrower will not permit the Property to be the subject of any court order affecting Borrowers rights to the Property in any action by anyone other than Lender. If the Property includes chattel paper or instruments, either as original collateral or as proceeds of the Property, Borrower will note Lenders security interest on the face of the chattel paper or instruments. If Borrower determines to obtain Purchase Money Financing, Borrower first will request such Purchase Money Financing from Lender, and only if Lender declines to provide the requested Purchase Money Financing will Borrower obtain Purchase Money Financing from another Lender. If Borrower obtains Purchase Money Financing from another Lender, Borrower will provide Lender with copies of the Purchase Money Financing documentation. (4) Sale of Finished Goods. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, so long as Borrower is not in default under this Agreement and Lender has not notified Borrower of any acceleration of the Loan, Borrower shall have the right to sell Finished Goods, fixtures, equipment and other personal property to third parties, provided that all such sales and replacements are in the ordinary course of business. (5) Patents. Prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Borrower has executed and delivered to Lender all documentation required by Lender to transfer all or some of the Patents to Lender, including, without limitation, documentation necessary to transfer ownership of the applicable Patents to Lender at the United States Patent Office.

Acceleration Lender may make all or any part of the amount owing by the terms of the Loan immediately due.

Set-Off Lender may use the right of set-off. This means Lender may set-off any amount due and payable under the terms of the Loan against any right Borrower has to receive money from Lender. Borrowers right to receive money from Lender includes any deposit or share account balance Borrower has with Lender, any money owed to Borrower on an item presented to Lender or in Lenders possession for collection or exchange, and any repurchase agreement or other non-deposit obligation. Any amount due and payable under the terms of the Loan means the total amount to which Lender is entitled to demand payment under the terms of the Loan at the time Lender set-off. Subject to any other written contract, if Borrowers right to receive money from Lender is also owned by someone who has not agreed to pay the Loan, Lenders right of set-off will apply to Borrowers interest in the obligation and to any other amounts Borrower could withdraw on Borrowers sole request or endorsement. Lenders right of set-off does not apply to an account or other obligation where Borrowers rights arise only in a representative capacity. It also does not apply to any Individual Retirement Account or other tax-deferred retirement account. Lender will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because Lender set-off against any of Borrowers accounts. Borrower agrees to hold Lender harmless from any such claims arising as a result of Lenders exercise of Lenders right of set-off. G. Assembly of Property Lender may require Borrower to assemble the Property and make the Property available to Lender in a reasonable fashion. H. Possession Lender may take possession of the Property so long as such taking of possession does not involve a breach of the peace. Lender may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the Property in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Lender may apply what Lender receives from the disposition of the Property to Lenders expenses, Lenders attorneys fees and legal expenses, where not prohibited by law, and to the Secured Debts. If proceeds received by Lender from the disposition of the Property do not satisfy the Secured Debts, Borrower shall remain liable for the deficiency (where permitted by law). In some cases, Lender may keep the Property to satisfy the Secured Debts. Where a notice is required, Borrower agrees that ten days prior written notice sent by first class mail to Borrowers address listed in this Agreement will be reasonable notice to Borrower under the Texas Business and Commerce Code (UCC). If the Property is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value, Lender may, without notice to Borrower, dispose of any or all of the Property in a commercially reasonable manner at Borrowers expense following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing. If any items not otherwise subject to this Agreement are contained in the Property when Lender takes possession, Lender may hold such items for Borrowers account and Borrowers risk, and Lender will not be liable for taking possession of such items.

Use and Operation Lender may enter upon any premises upon or within which the Property is located and take possession of all or any part of the Property for the purpose of preserving the Property or the Propertys value, so long as Lender does not breach the peace.

Lender and Borrower may, whether or not any arbitration has begun: pursue any self-help or similar remedies, including taking property or exercising other rights under applicable laws; seek attachment, garnishment, receivership or other provisional remedies from a court having jurisdiction to preserve the rights of or to prevent irreparable injury to Lender or Borrower; or foreclose against any property by any method or take legal action to recover any property. Foreclosing or exercising a power of sale, beginning and continuing a judicial action or pursuing self-help remedies will not constitute a waiver of the right to complete arbitration. D. Arbitrators Authority. The arbitrator will determine whether a Dispute is arbitrable. A single arbitrator will resolve any Dispute, whether individual or joint in nature, or whether based on contract, tort or any other matter at law or in equity. The arbitrator may consolidate any Dispute with any related disputes, claims or other matters in question not arising out of the Loan. Any court having jurisdiction may enter a judgment or decree on the arbitrators award. The judgment or decree will be enforced as any other judgment or decree. E. Interstate Commerce. Lender and Borrower acknowledge that the agreements, transactions or the relationships which result from the agreements or transactions between Lender and Borrower involve interstate commerce. The United States Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. F. AAA Rules. The American Arbitration Associations Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of this Agreement will govern the selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration process, unless otherwise agreed to in this Agreement or in another written agreement. G. Waiver of Trial for Arbitration. Lender and Borrower understand that the Lender and Borrower have the right or opportunity to litigate any Dispute through a trial by judge or jury but that Lender and Borrower parties prefer to resolve any Dispute through arbitration instead of litigation. If any Dispute is arbitrated, Lender and Borrower voluntarily and knowingly waive the right to have a trial by jury or judge during the arbitration. H. Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 17 to the contrary, either party shall have the right to seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties.", "section_full_title": "17.AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE", "document_id": "1MDBfnMlsXGieO2H6r6AVK.", "section_title": "AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE"}, {"text": " Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall not be in default for failure to pay or discharge any mechanics or materialmans lien asserted against the Property if, and so long as: (i) Borrower shall have notified Lender of same within five (5) days of obtaining Page 22 knowledge thereof; (ii) Borrower shall diligently and in good faith contest the same by appropriate legal proceedings which shall operate to prevent the enforcement or collection of the same and the sale of the Property, or any part thereof, to satisfy the same; (iii) if the asserted lien is more than $250,000, Borrower shall have furnished to Lender a cash deposit, or an indemnity bond satisfactory to Lender with a surety satisfactory to Lender, in the amount of the mechanics or materialmans lien claim, plus a reasonable additional sum to pay all costs, interest and penalties that may be imposed or incurred in connection therewith, to assure payment of the matters under contest and to prevent any sale or forfeiture of the Property, or any part thereof; (iv) Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the amount of any such claim so determined, together with all costs, interest and penalties which may be payable in connection therewith; (v) the failure to pay the mechanics or materialmans lien claim does not constitute a default under any other deed of trust, mortgage or security interest covering or affecting any part of the Property; and (vi) notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower immediately shall, upon request of Lender, pay (and if Borrower shall fail so to do, Lender may, but shall not be required to, pay or cause to be discharged or bonded against) any such claim notwithstanding such contest, if in the reasonable opinion of Lender the Property shall be in jeopardy or in danger of being forfeited or foreclosed.

The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used solely for costs related to refinancing current Indebtedness of Borrower with National City Bank. The term of the Term Note shall be payable over a 364-day term with amortization based on a fifteen (15)-year straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization period. Bank acknowledges that Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower has made application to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for approval to enter into a long term note made payable to Bank and further acknowledges that prior approval of the PUCO must be obtained for any notes payable for a period of more than twelve months after the date of making the note. Subject to and only after the receipt of the required approval of the PUCO in Case No. 08-699-GA-AIS on or prior to the 364th day after the date of the Term Note (the PUCO Approval), Bank and Borrower agree that on the 365th day after the date of the Term Note, the Term Note shall convert to a four (4)-year term loan payable over a four (4)-year period with amortization based on a fourteen (14)-year straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization period. Upon conversion as foresaid, the Term Loan shall mature on July ___, 2013, unless earlier accelerated as provided herein or in the Term Note (the Term Loan Maturity or Term Loan Maturity Date). If the PUCO Approval is not obtained by the 364th day after the date of the Term Note, the Term Note shall become due and payable on said 364th day after the date of the Term Note, which date shall then be the Term Loan Maturity or Term Loan Maturity Date. The Term Note shall bear interest at a variable rate equal to the Interest Rate per annum. In the event of a change in the Interest Rate from time to time, the interest rate under the Term Note shall change without notice as of the first day of each month. Interest shall be calculated based on a 360-day year and charged for the actual number of days elapsed. After maturity of the Term Note, whether as stated, by acceleration or otherwise, the Term Note shall bear interest (computed in the same manner, and with the same effect, as interest hereon prior to maturity but at the higher rate) payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate, until paid, and whether before or after the entry of judgment hereon. Any amounts repaid under the Term Note may not be re-borrowed. All payments under the Term Note shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America to Bank at its office at 328 S. Saginaw Street, Flint, Michigan 48502, or at such place as shall hereafter be designated by written notice from the holder to 5 Borrower. To evidence the Term Loan, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Bank the Term Note, in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, with appropriate insertions, the terms of which are incorporated herein by this reference. Borrower shall make principal plus interest payments on the Term Loan due and payable monthly and continuing on the first day of each month, commencing on September 1, 2008, and continuing on the first day of each and every consecutive month thereafter, with a final payment in the amount of the then remaining balance of principal, plus interest thereof due and payable in full on Term Loan Maturity Date. The monthly principal plus interest payment amounts shall be based on the straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization schedules set forth above. Upon each change in the Interest Rate, upward or downward, the amount of the monthly interest payments will be correspondingly adjusted on the first monthly payment due date following such interest rate adjustment. Borrower may prepay the principal balance of the Term Note, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. However, in the event Borrower and Bank enter into one or more Rate Management Agreements, pursuant to which Borrower is managing interest rate risk associated with the Term Note, under certain circumstances described in the Rate Management Agreement, Borrower may incur additional financial obligations in the nature of early termination payments (Termination Obligations) if the Term Note is prepaid. Subject to satisfying any applicable Termination Obligations, Borrower is not legally prohibited from paying all or a portion of the Term Note balance earlier than it is due, but Borrower should consult with Bank and consider the financial impact of such action before doing so. In the case of a partial prepayment of the Term Note, a corresponding adjustment to the Rate Management Agreement (Partial Termination) is recommended to preserve Borrowers right of consolidated financial accounting treatment for the Term Note and the Rate Management Agreement. Any such early payments shall not, unless agreed to by Bank in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrowers obligation to continue to make payments under the Term Note payment schedule. Borrower agrees not to send Bank payments marked paid in full, without recourse, or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Bank may accept it without losing any of Banks rights under the Term Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Bank. All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes payment in full of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Citizens Bank, P.O.

Section 5318: IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for Borrower: When Borrower opens an account, if Borrower is an individual, Bank will ask for Borrowers name, taxpayer identification number, residential address, date of birth, and other information that will allow Bank to identify Borrower, and, if Borrower is not an individual, Bank will ask for Borrowers name, taxpayer identification number, business address, and other information that will allow Bank to identify Borrower. Bank may also ask, if Borrower is an individual, to see Borrowers drivers license or other identifying documents, and, if Borrower is not an individual, to see Borrowers legal organizational documents or other identifying documents. Bank is required to follow this procedure each time an account is opened, even if Borrower is a current customer of Bank. 9.22 Governing Law; Jurisdiction This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic laws of the State of Ohio. Borrower agrees that the state and federal courts in or having jurisdiction over Cuyahoga County, Ohio, has exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of this Agreement, and that service of process in any such proceeding shall be effective if mailed to Borrower at the address described in the Notices section of this Agreement. Section 10.Additional Provisions Relating To Libor Rates; Increased Capital; Taxes.  10.1 Reserves or Deposit Requirements, Etc. If, at any time, any law, treaty or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or the interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority shall impose (whether or not having the force of law), modify or deem applicable any reserve and/or special deposit requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the amount of any Loan by, Bank, and the result of the foregoing is to increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to Bank of making or maintaining hereunder such Loan or to reduce the amount of principal or interest received by Bank with respect to such Loan, then, upon demand by Bank, Borrower shall pay to Bank from time to time on demand, as additional consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient to fully compensate and indemnify Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount, assuming (which assumption Bank need not corroborate) such additional cost or reduced amount was allocable to such Loan; provided, however, Borrower shall only be required to pay such amounts to the extent that Bank is charging such amounts to the majority of its similarly-situated borrowers. A certificate as to the increased cost or reduced amount as a result of any event mentioned in this Section 10.1, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be promptly submitted by Bank to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Bank shall notify Borrower as promptly as practicable of the existence of any event that will likely require the payment by Borrower of any such additional amount under this Section. 10.2 Tax Law, Etc. In the event that by reason of any law, regulation or requirement or in the interpretation thereof by an official authority, or the imposition of any requirement of any central bank whether or not having the force of law, Bank shall, with respect to this Agreement or any transaction under this Agreement, be subjected to any tax, levy, impost, charge, fee, duty, deduction or withholding of any kind whatsoever (other than any tax imposed upon the total net income of Bank), then Bank shall promptly notify Borrower stating the reasons therefor. Borrower shall thereafter pay to Bank, upon demand from time to time, as additional consideration 25 hereunder, such additional amounts as shall fully compensate Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate as to any such increased cost or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be submitted by Bank to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. If Bank receives such additional consideration from Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.2, Bank shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts on account of which such additional consideration has been paid and shall reimburse Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, that Bank shall receive a refund of such taxes or other amounts together with any interest thereon or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of Bank) of the United States or any state or subdivision thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to Bank. If, at the time any audit of Banks income tax return is completed, Bank determines, based on such audit, that it was not entitled to the full amount of any refund reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid or that its net income taxes are not reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount of taxes reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid, Borrower, upon demand of Bank, shall promptly pay to Bank the amount so refunded to which Bank was not so entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of Bank were not so reduced, as the case may be. Any and all payments or reimbursements made hereunder or under this Agreement, the Note or other Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Charges, present or future, taxes, levies, imposts, deductions or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto of any nature whatsoever imposed by any governmental authority (Taxes). If Borrower is required by law to deduct any Taxes, excluding such Taxes to the extent imposed on or measured by Banks net income by the jurisdiction in which Bank is organized (all such non-excluded Taxes being referred to herein as Non-Excluded Taxes). If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any such amounts from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to Bank, then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions, Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made.

The proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used solely for costs related to refinancing current Indebtedness of Borrower with National City Bank. The term of the Term Note shall be payable over a 364-day term with amortization based on a fifteen (15)-year straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization period. Bank acknowledges that Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower has made application to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for approval to enter into a long term note made payable to Bank and further acknowledges that prior approval of the PUCO must be obtained for any notes payable for a period of more than twelve months after the date of making the note. Subject to and only after the receipt of the required approval of the PUCO in Case No. 08-699-GA-AIS on or prior to the 364th day after the date of the Term Note (the PUCO Approval), Bank and Borrower agree that on the 365th day after the date of the Term Note, the Term Note shall convert to a four (4)-year term loan payable over a four (4)-year period with amortization based on a fourteen (14)-year straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization period. Upon conversion as foresaid, the Term Loan shall mature on July ___, 2013, unless earlier accelerated as provided herein or in the Term Note (the Term Loan Maturity or Term Loan Maturity Date). If the PUCO Approval is not obtained by the 364th day after the date of the Term Note, the Term Note shall become due and payable on said 364th day after the date of the Term Note, which date shall then be the Term Loan Maturity or Term Loan Maturity Date. The Term Note shall bear interest at a variable rate equal to the Interest Rate per annum. In the event of a change in the Interest Rate from time to time, the interest rate under the Term Note shall change without notice as of the first day of each month. Interest shall be calculated based on a 360-day year and charged for the actual number of days elapsed. After maturity of the Term Note, whether as stated, by acceleration or otherwise, the Term Note shall bear interest (computed in the same manner, and with the same effect, as interest hereon prior to maturity but at the higher rate) payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate, until paid, and whether before or after the entry of judgment hereon. Any amounts repaid under the Term Note may not be re-borrowed. All payments under the Term Note shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America to Bank at its office at 328 S. Saginaw Street, Flint, Michigan 48502, or at such place as shall hereafter be designated by written notice from the holder to Borrower. To evidence the Term Loan, Borrower shall execute and deliver to Bank the Term Note, in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto, with appropriate 5 insertions, the terms of which are incorporated herein by this reference. Borrower shall make principal plus interest payments on the Term Loan due and payable monthly and continuing on the first day of each month, commencing on September 1, 2008, and continuing on the first day of each and every consecutive month thereafter, with a final payment in the amount of the then remaining balance of principal, plus interest thereof due and payable in full on Term Loan Maturity Date. The monthly principal plus interest payment amounts shall be based on the straight-line level payment principal plus interest amortization schedules set forth above. Upon each change in the Interest Rate, upward or downward, the amount of the monthly interest payments will be correspondingly adjusted on the first monthly payment due date following such interest rate adjustment. Borrower may prepay the principal balance of the Term Note, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. However, in the event Borrower and Bank enter into one or more Rate Management Agreements, pursuant to which Borrower is managing interest rate risk associated with the Term Note, under certain circumstances described in the Rate Management Agreement, Borrower may incur additional financial obligations in the nature of early termination payments (Termination Obligations) if the Term Note is prepaid. Subject to satisfying any applicable Termination Obligations, Borrower is not legally prohibited from paying all or a portion of the Term Note balance earlier than it is due, but Borrower should consult with Bank and consider the financial impact of such action before doing so. In the case of a partial prepayment of the Term Note, a corresponding adjustment to the Rate Management Agreement (Partial Termination) is recommended to preserve Borrowers right of consolidated financial accounting treatment for the Term Note and the Rate Management Agreement. Any such early payments shall not, unless agreed to by Bank in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrowers obligation to continue to make payments under the Term Note payment schedule. Borrower agrees not to send Bank payments marked paid in full, without recourse, or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Bank may accept it without losing any of Banks rights under the Term Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Bank.

If Bank advances its own funds for such purposes, such funds shall be secured by the Loan Documents, notwithstanding that such advances may cause the total amount advanced hereunder to exceed the amount committed to be advanced pursuant to this Agreement, and Borrower shall immediately upon demand reimburse Bank therefor with interest at the Default Rate, from the date of such advance until the date of reimbursement; and (d) Exercise any and all of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise as a secured creditor, including, without limitation, foreclosing on any security, and exercising any other rights with respect to security whether under the Loan Documents or any other agreement or as provided by law, all in such order and in such manner as Bank in its sole discretion may determine 6.3 Setoff If any Event of Default shall occur, Bank is authorized, without notice to Borrower, to offset and apply to all or any part of the Obligations all moneys, credits and other property of any nature whatsoever of Borrower now or at any time hereafter in the possession of, in transit to or from, under the control or custody of, or on deposit with (whether held by Borrower individually or jointly with another party), Bank, including but not limited to certificates of deposit. 6.4 Default Rate After the occurrence of an Event of Default, all amounts of principal outstanding as of the date of the occurrence of such Event of Default shall bear interest at the Default Rate, in Banks sole discretion, without notice to Borrower. This provision does not constitute a waiver of any Events of Default or an agreement by Bank to permit any late payments whatsoever. 6.5 Late Payment Penalty If any payment is not paid when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise after the expiration of applicable notice grace and cure periods, if any), Borrower agrees to pay to Bank a late payment fee equal to five percent (5%) of the payment amount then due. 6.6 No Remedy Exclusive No remedy set forth herein is exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each is cumulative and in addition to every other remedy available under this Agreement, the Loan Documents or as may be now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute.

Any waiver of any covenant, term or condition contained herein shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same covenant, term or condition. The consent or approval by Bank to or of any act by Borrower shall not be deemed to waive or render unnecessary consent or approval to or of any subsequent act. 18 6.7 Effect of Termination The termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of either party or any obligation of either party to the other, arising prior to the effective date of such termination, and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all transactions entered into, rights created or Obligations incurred prior to such termination have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated.

Section 5318: IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for Borrower: When Borrower opens an account, if Borrower is an individual, Bank will ask for Borrowers name, taxpayer identification number, residential address, date of birth, and other information that will allow Bank to identify Borrower, and, if Borrower is not an individual, Bank will ask for Borrowers name, taxpayer identification number, business address, and other information that will allow Bank to identify Borrower. Bank may also ask, if Borrower is an individual, to see Borrowers drivers license or other identifying documents, and, if Borrower is not an individual, to see Borrowers legal organizational documents or other identifying documents. Bank is required to follow this procedure each time an account is opened, even if Borrower is a current customer of Bank. 9.22 Governing Law; Jurisdiction This Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the domestic laws of the State of Ohio.

Section 10.Additional Provisions Relating To Libor Rates; Increased Capital; Taxes.  10.1 Reserves or Deposit Requirements, Etc. If, at any time, any law, treaty or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or the interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority shall impose (whether or not having the force of law), modify or deem applicable any reserve and/or special deposit requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the amount of any Loan by, Bank, and the result of the foregoing is to increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to Bank of making or maintaining hereunder such Loan or to reduce the amount of principal or interest received by Bank with respect to such Loan, then, upon demand by Bank, Borrower shall pay to Bank from time to time on demand, as additional consideration hereunder, additional amounts sufficient to fully compensate and indemnify Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount, assuming (which assumption Bank need not corroborate) such additional cost or reduced amount was allocable to such Loan; provided, however, Borrower shall only be required to pay such amounts to the extent that Bank is charging such amounts to the majority of its similarly-situated borrowers. A certificate as to the increased cost or reduced amount as a result of any event mentioned in this Section 10.1, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be promptly submitted by Bank to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. Bank shall notify Borrower as promptly as practicable of the existence of any event that will likely require the payment by Borrower of any such additional amount under this Section. 10.2 Tax Law, Etc. In the event that by reason of any law, regulation or requirement or in the interpretation thereof by an official authority, or the imposition of any requirement of any central bank whether or not having the force of law, Bank shall, with respect to this Agreement or any transaction under this Agreement, be subjected to any tax, levy, impost, charge, fee, duty, deduction or withholding of any kind whatsoever (other than any tax imposed upon the total net income of Bank), then Bank shall promptly notify Borrower stating the reasons therefor. Borrower shall thereafter pay to Bank, upon demand from time to time, as additional consideration 25 hereunder, such additional amounts as shall fully compensate Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount. A certificate as to any such increased cost or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be submitted by Bank to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof. If Bank receives such additional consideration from Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.2, Bank shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts on account of which such additional consideration has been paid and shall reimburse Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, that Bank shall receive a refund of such taxes or other amounts together with any interest thereon or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of Bank) of the United States or any state or subdivision thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to Bank. If, at the time any audit of Banks income tax return is completed, Bank determines, based on such audit, that it was not entitled to the full amount of any refund reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid or that its net income taxes are not reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount of taxes reimbursed to Borrower as aforesaid, Borrower, upon demand of Bank, shall promptly pay to Bank the amount so refunded to which Bank was not so entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of Bank were not so reduced, as the case may be. Any and all payments or reimbursements made hereunder or under this Agreement, the Note or other Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Charges, present or future, taxes, levies, imposts, deductions or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto of any nature whatsoever imposed by any governmental authority (Taxes). If Borrower is required by law to deduct any Taxes, excluding such Taxes to the extent imposed on or measured by Banks net income by the jurisdiction in which Bank is organized (all such non-excluded Taxes being referred to herein as Non-Excluded Taxes). If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any such amounts from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to Bank, then the sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions, Bank receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made. If any amounts are payable in respect of Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, Borrower agrees to reimburse Bank, upon the written request of Bank, for net additional taxes imposed on or measured by the net income of Bank and for any withholding of taxes as Bank shall determine are payable by, or withheld from Bank, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of Bank pursuant to this sentence. All required deductions shall be withheld and paid over to the relevant governmental unit in accordance with applicable law. Borrower will indemnify Bank for the full amount of Non-Excluded Taxes (including any Non-Excluded Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 10.2) paid by Bank and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto whether or not such Non-Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally asserted. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability prepared by Bank, absent manifest error, shall be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes. Such indemnification shall be made within ten (10) days after the date Bank makes written demand therefor. 10.3 Eurodollar Deposits Unavailable or Interest Rate Unascertainable.

Each Additional Registration Statement prepared pursuant hereto shall register for resale at least that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Additional Required Registration Amount as of date the Registration Statement is initially filed with the SEC. Each Additional Registration Statement shall contain customary Selling Stockholders and Plan of Distribution sections. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have each Additional Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Additional Effectiveness Deadline.

The initial number of Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement and any increase in the number of Registrable Securities included therein shall be allocated pro rata among the Investors based on the number of Registrable Securities held by each Investor at the time the Registration Statement covering such initial number of Registrable Securities or increase thereof is declared effective by the SEC. In the event that an Investor sells or otherwise transfers any of such Investors Registrable Securities, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement for such transferor. Any shares of Common Stock included in a Registration Statement and which remain allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall be allocated to the remaining Investors, pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities then held by such Investors which are covered by such Registration Statement. In no event shall the Company include any securities other than Registrable Securities on any Registration Statement without the prior written consent of the Required Holders or the Investor Representative.If the SEC requires that the Company register less than the amount of Registrable Securities originally included on any Registration Statement at the time it was filed, the Registrable Securities on such Registration Statement shall be decreased on a pro rata basis and, unless otherwise requested by an Investor, the Warrant Shares included on such Registration Statement shall be decreased first. (d)Sufficient Number of Shares Registered. In the event the number of shares available under a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(a) is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered by such Registration Statement or an Investors allocated portion of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2(c), the Company shall amend the applicable Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on Form S-3, if available), or both, so as to cover at least the Required Registration Amount as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new Registration Statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the necessity therefor arises. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment and/or new Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof. For purposes of the foregoing provision, the number of shares available under a Registration Statement shall be deemed insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock available for resale under the Registration Statement is less than the product determined by multiplying (i) the Required Registration Amount as of such time by (ii) 0.90. 5 (e)Effect of Failure to File and Obtain and Maintain Effectiveness of Registration Statement.

(9)OPTIONAL REDEMPTION AT THE COMPANYS ELECTION. (a)General If at any time after the Shareholder Approval Date (the Company Optional Redemption Eligibility Date), (i) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Shares listed on the Principal Market exceeds 175% of the Conversion Price then in effect for each of twenty (20) Trading Days out of any thirty (30) consecutive Trading Day period following the Company Optional Redemption Eligibility Date (the Company Optional Redemption Measuring Period), (ii) the average daily dollar trading volume (as reported on Bloomberg) of the Common Shares on the Principal Market over the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date exceeds $1 million and (iii) no Equity Conditions Failure has occurred, the Company shall have the right to redeem all or any portion of the Conversion Amount then remaining under this Note (the Company Optional Redemption Amount) in the Company Optional Redemption Notice (as defined below) on the Company Optional Redemption 13 Date (each as defined below) (an Company Optional Redemption). The portion of this Note subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 9(a) shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price (the Company Optional Redemption Price) equal to the Conversion Amount being redeemed together with the Make-Whole Amount and any accrued and unpaid Interest and Late Charges, if any, on such Conversion Amount and Interest through the Company Optional Redemption Date (as defined below). The Company may exercise its right to require redemption under this Section 9 by delivering a written notice thereof by facsimile and overnight courier to all, but not less than all, of the holders of Notes (the Company Optional Redemption Notice and the date all of the holders of Notes received such notice is referred to as the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date). The Company may not effect more than one (1) Company Optional Redemption in any thirty (30) Trading Day period. The Company may deliver only two (2) Company Optional Redemption Notices hereunder and each such Company Optional Redemption Notice shall be irrevocable. The Company Optional Redemption Notice shall (x) state the date on which the Company Optional Redemption shall occur (the Company Optional Redemption Date) which date shall not be less than ten (10) Trading Days nor more than thirty (30) Trading Days following the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date, (y) certify that there has been no Equity Conditions Failure and (z) state the aggregate Conversion Amount of the Notes which is being redeemed in such Company Optional Redemption from the Holder and all of the other holders of the Notes pursuant to this Section 9(a) (and analogous provisions under the Other Notes) on the Company Optional Redemption Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9, at any time prior to the date the Company Optional Redemption Price is paid, in full, the Company Optional Redemption Amount may be converted, in whole or in part, by the Holders into Common Shares pursuant to Section 3. All Conversion Amounts converted by the Holder after the Company Optional Redemption Notice Date shall reduce the Company Optional Redemption Amount of this Note required to be redeemed on the Company Optional Redemption Date. Redemptions made pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made in accordance with Section 12. (b)Pro Rata Redemption Requirement If the Company elects to cause a Company Optional Redemption of this Note pursuant to Section 9(a), then it must simultaneously take the same action with respect to the Other Notes. If the Company elects to cause a Company Optional Redemption pursuant to Section 9(a) (or similar provisions under the Other Notes) with respect to less than all of the Conversion Amounts of the Notes then outstanding, then the Company shall require redemption of a Conversion Amount from each of the holders of the Notes equal to the product of (i) the aggregate Conversion Amount of Notes which the Company has elected to cause to be redeemed pursuant to Section 9(a), multiplied by (ii) the fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the aggregate Original Principal Amount of the Notes purchased by such holder of outstanding Notes and the denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate Original Principal Amount of the Notes purchased by all holders holding outstanding Notes (such fraction with respect to each holder is referred to as its Company Redemption Allocation Percentage, and such amount with respect to each holder is referred to as its Pro Rata Company Redemption Amount); provided, however, that in the event that any holders Pro Rata Company Redemption Amount exceeds the outstanding Principal amount of such holders Note, then such excess Pro Rata Company Redemption Amount shall be allocated amongst the remaining holders of Notes in accordance with the foregoing formula. In the event that the initial holder of any Notes shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holders Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holders Company Redemption Allocation Percentage and Pro Rata Company Redemption Amount. (10)NONCIRCUMVENTION. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Notice of Articles, Articles or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. (11)RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES. (a)Reservation The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares a number of Common Shares for each of the Notes equal to 125% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount of each such Note as of the Original Issuance Date. So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Notes, 125% of the number of Common Shares as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Notes then outstanding; provided that at no time shall the number of Common Shares so reserved be less than the number 14 of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions) (the Required Reserve Amount). The initial number of Common Shares reserved for conversions of the Notes and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the holders of the Notes based on the principal amount of the Notes held by each holder at the Closing (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) or increase in the number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the Authorized Share Allocation). In the event that a holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such holders Notes, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such holders Authorized Share Allocation. Any Common Shares reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Notes shall be allocated to the remaining holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of the Notes then held by such holders. (b)Insufficient Authorized Shares If at any time while any of the Notes remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved Common Shares to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Notes at least a number of Common Shares equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an Authorized Share Failure), then the Company shall immediately take all action necessary to increase the Companys authorized Common Shares to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for the Notes then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its shareholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized Common Shares. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each shareholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its shareholders approval of such increase in authorized Common Shares and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the shareholders that they approve such proposal. (12)REDEMPTIONS. (a)Mechanics The Company shall deliver the applicable Event of Default Redemption Price to the Holder within five (5) Trading Days after the Companys receipt of the Holders Event of Default Redemption Notice. If the Holder has submitted a Change of Control Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 5(b), the Company shall deliver the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price to the Holder (i) concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control and (ii) within five (5) Trading Days after the Companys receipt of such Change of Control Redemption Notice otherwise. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Installment Redemption Price to the Holder on the applicable Installment Date. The Company shall deliver the applicable Company Optional Redemption Price on the Company Optional Redemption Date. In the event of a redemption of less than all of the Conversion Amount of this Note, the Company shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) representing the outstanding Principal which has not been redeemed. In the event that the Company does not pay the applicable Redemption Price to the Holder within the time period required, at any time thereafter and until the Company pays such unpaid Redemption Price in full, the Holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the Company to promptly return to the Holder all or any portion of this Note representing the Conversion Amount that was submitted for redemption and for which the applicable Redemption Price (together with any Late Charges thereon) has not been paid. Upon the Companys receipt of such notice, (x) the applicable Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such Conversion Amount, (y) the Company shall immediately return this Note, or issue a new Note (in accordance with Section 18(d)) to the Holder representing such Conversion Amount to be redeemed and (z) the Conversion Price of this Note or such new Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is voided and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price of the Common Shares during the period beginning on and including the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is delivered to the Company and ending on and including the date on which the applicable Redemption Notice is voided. The Holders delivery of a notice voiding a Redemption Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice shall not affect the Companys obligations to make any payments of Late Charges which have accrued prior to the date of such notice with respect to the Conversion Amount subject to such notice. (b)Redemption by Other Holders Upon the Companys receipt of notice from any of the holders of the Other Notes for redemption or repayment as a result of an event or occurrence substantially similar to the events or occurrences described in Section 4(b) or Section 5(b) (each, an Other Redemption Notice), the Company shall immediately, but no later than one (1) Trading Day of its receipt thereof, forward to the Holder by facsimile a copy of such notice.

Except with respect to such dividends or other distributions in which an adjustment has been made to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 7(a) above, the Holder, as the holder of this Note, shall be entitled to receive such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of Common Shares to the same extent as if the Holder had converted this Note into Common Shares (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such Common Shares on the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of Common Shares (provided, however, to the extent that the Holders right to participate in any such dividend or distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution to such extent (or the beneficial ownership of any such Common Shares as a result of such dividend or distribution to such extent) and such dividend or distribution to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage). (16)VOTE TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF, NOTES. The affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders shall be required for any change or amendment to this Note or the Other Notes.

The remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Note and any of the other Transaction Documents at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the Holders right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Note. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof).
