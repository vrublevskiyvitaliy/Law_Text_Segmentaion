(this Agreement), dated as of [], 2010, is by and between China Hydroelectric Corporation, a Cayman Islands company (the Company), and The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York banking corporation (the Warrant Agent).<br><br>WHEREAS, the Company proposes to issue up to 3,593,750 warrants to be offered in the Companys initial public offering of ADSs (as defined below) and Warrants (as defined below) (the IPO) pursuant to a registration statement (the Registration Statement) filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.<br>Each American Depositary Share (ADS) representing three ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the Ordinary Shares), and one warrant (the Warrants) to purchase three Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $15.00 for three Ordinary Shares (the Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants, the Warrant Shares);<br>WHEREAS, the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing to so act, in connection with the issuance, transfer, exchange and exercise of Warrants and other matters as provided herein.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:<br><ul><li>SECTION 1.Appointment of Warrant Agent.</li><br>The Company hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company for purposes of the administration of the Warrants in accordance with the instructions set forth in this Agreement, and the Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment.<br><br><li>SECTION 2.Warrant Certificates.</li><br>The certificates including the global warrants certificates evidencing the Warrants (the Warrant Certificates) to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in registered form only and shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto.<br><br><li>SECTION 3.Execution of Warrant Certificates.</li><br>Warrant Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board or its President or Chief Executive Officer or a Vice President and by its Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.<br>Each such signature upon the Warrant Certificates may be in the form of a facsimile signature of the present or any future Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant Certificates and for that purpose the Company may adopt and use the facsimile signature of any person who shall have been Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Warrant Certificates shall be countersigned and delivered or disposed of he or she shall have ceased to hold such office.<br><br>In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such officer before the Warrant Certificates so signed shall have been countersigned by the Warrant Agent, or disposed of by the Company, such Warrant Certificates nevertheless may be countersigned and delivered or disposed of as though such person had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Warrant Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Warrant Agreement any such person was not such officer.<br><br>Warrant Certificates shall be dated the date of countersignature by the Warrant Agent.<br><br><li>SECTION 4.Registration and Countersignature.</li><br>Warrant Certificates shall be countersigned by the Warrant Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned.<br>The Warrant Agent shall, upon the written instructions of the Chairman of the Board, the President or Chief Executive Officer, a Vice President, the Treasurer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, countersign, issue and deliver Warrants as provided in this Agreement.<br><br>The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the registered holder(s) of the Warrant Certificates as the absolute owner(s) thereof (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by anyone), for all purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.<br><br>2<br><li>SECTION 5.Transfers and Exchanges.</li><br>The Company will provide the Warrant Agent with Warrant certificate issuance instructions after the close of the IPO.<br>At such time, the Warrant Agent will keep or cause to be kept, books for registration and transfer of the Warrant Certificate(s) including any global warrant certificate issued hereunder.<br>Such books shall show the name(s) and address(es) of any holder of the Warrants, the number of China Hydroelectric Warrants on the fact of the Warrant and the date thereon.<br>The Warrant Agent shall from time to time, subject to the limitations of this Section 5, register the transfer of any outstanding Warrant Certificates upon the records to be maintained by it for that purpose, upon surrender thereof duly endorsed or accompanied (if so required by the Warrant Agent) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, including a Medallion guarantee duly executed by the registered holder or holders thereof or by the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by a duly authorized attorney.<br>Upon any such registration of transfer, a new Warrant Certificate shall be issued to the transferee(s) and the surrendered Warrant Certificate shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent.<br>Cancelled Warrant Certificates shall thereafter be disposed of by the Warrant Agent in its customary manner.<br><br>Each Warrant shall initially be issued together with one ADS.<br>The ADS and the accompanying Warrant shall be separately transferable immediately upon the consummation of the IPO.<br><br>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at the option of the holder(s) thereof, when surrendered to the Warrant Agent at its principal corporate trust office, which is currently located at the address listed in Section 17 hereof, for another Warrant Certificate or other Warrant Certificates of like tenor and representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants.<br>Any holder desiring to exchange a Warrant Certificate shall deliver a written request to the Warrant Agent, and shall surrender, duly endorsed or accompanied (if so required by the Warrant Agent) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent, the Warrant Certificate or Certificates to be so exchanged.<br>Warrant Certificates surrendered for exchange shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent.<br>Such cancelled Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by such Warrant Agent in its customary manner.<br><br>The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to countersign, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 hereof and of this Section 5, the new Warrant Certificates required pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.<br><br>Warrant Agent shall follow its regular procedures to attempt to reconcile any discrepancies between the number of Warrants that any exercise instructions may indicate and the number that the Warrant Agent indicates such holder owns.<br>In any instance where Warrant Agent cannot reconcile such discrepancies by following such procedures, Warrant Agent will consult with the Company for instructions as to the number of certificated Warrants, if any, Warrant Agent is authorized to accept for exercise.<br>In the absence of such instructions, Warrant Agent is authorized not to accept any such certificated Warrants for exercise and will return to the Warrant holder (at Warrant Agent's option by either first class mail under a blanket surety bond or insurance protecting Warrant Agent and the Company from losses or liabilities arising out of the non-receipt or non-delivery of such Warrants or by registered mail insured separately for the value of such Warrants) to such Warrant holder's address as set forth in the Warrants surrendered in connection with an exercise.<br><br><li>SECTION 6.Terms of

Warrants are redeemed pursuant to Section 6(b) below.<br><br>Business Day shall mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or any other day on which banks in the City of New York, New York, are authorized or required by law to close.<br><br>Each Warrant not exercised or redeemed prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Warrant Exercise Period shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time.<br><br><li>(b)Redemption of Warrants</li>3<br>The Company may call the Warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Warrant, upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each Warrant holder, at any time after such Warrants have become exercisable pursuant to Section 6(a) above, if, and only if, (A) the Closing Price has equaled or exceeded $23.00 per ADS for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading-day period ending on the third Business Day prior to the notice of redemption to Warrant holders and (B) at all times between the date of such notice of redemption and the

their addresses as they appear in the warrant register.<br><br>The Closing Price of the ADSs on any date of determination means: (A) the last reported sale price for the regular trading session (without considering after hours or other trading outside regular trading session hours) of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, (B) if the ADSs are not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, the last reported sale price reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the ADSs are so listed, (C) if the

the ADSs are not so quoted, the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the ADSs from at least three nationally recognized investment banking firms that the Company selects for

at the address listed in Section 17 hereof, of the Warrant Certificate or Certificates to be exercised with the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof duly filled in and signed and such other documentation as the Warrant Agent may reasonably request, and upon payment to the Warrant Agent for the account of the Company of the Exercise Price (adjusted as herein provided if applicable) for the number of Warrant Shares in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised.<br>Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made by certified check or wire transfer in lawful money of the United States of America.<br>In no event will any Warrants be settled on a net cash basis.<br><br>Subject to the provisions of Section 7 hereof, upon such surrender of Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price the Company shall issue and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to and in such name or names as the Warrant holder may designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants.<br>Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date of the surrender of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price.<br><br>The Warrants shall be exercisable, at the election of the holders thereof, either in full or from time to time in part and, in the event that a certificate evidencing Warrants is exercised in respect of fewer than all of the Warrant Shares issuable on such exercise at any time prior to the date of expiration of the Warrants, a new certificate evidencing the remaining Warrant or Warrants will be issued, and the Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to countersign and to deliver the required new Warrant Certificate or Certificates pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof and of this Section 6, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent, shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.<br>The Warrant Agent may assume that any Warrant presented for exercise is permitted to be so exercised under applicable law and shall have no liability for acting in reliance on such assumption.<br><br>All Warrant Certificates surrendered upon exercise of Warrants shall be canceled by the Warrant Agent.<br>Such canceled Warrant Certificates shall then be disposed of by the Warrant Agent in its customary manner.<br>The Warrant Agent shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently pay to the Company all cleared monies received by the Warrant Agent for the purchase of the Warrant Shares through the exercise of such Warrants.<br><br>The Warrant Agent shall keep copies of this Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available for inspection by the holders with reasonable prior written notice during normal business hours at its office.<br>The Company shall supply the Warrant Agent from time to time with such numbers of copies of this Agreement as the Warrant Agent may request.<br><br>4<br><li>(d)Registration Requirement</li>Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 6, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (A) a registration statement covering the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Warrants is effective under the Securities Act and (B) a prospectus thereunder relating to the Warrant Shares is current.<br>The Company shall use its best efforts to have a registration statement in effect covering Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants from the date the Warrants become exercisable and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Warrant Shares until the Warrants expire or are redeemed.<br>In no event shall the Company be required to issue unregistered shares upon the exercise of any Warrant or settle Warrants on a net cash basis.<br><br></ul><li>SECTION 7.Payment of Taxes.</li><br>The Company will pay all documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue of any Warrant Certificates or any certificates for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered holder of a Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Warrant Certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.<br><br><li>SECTION 8.Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates.</li><br>In case any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue and the Warrant Agent shall countersign, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent of such loss, theft or destruction of such Warrant Certificate and indemnity, also satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent.<br>Applicants for such new Warrant Certificates must pay such reasonable charges as the Company may prescribe.<br><br><li>SECTION 9.Reservation of Warrant Shares.</li><br>The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares or its authorized and issued Ordinary Shares held in its treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of Warrants, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may then be deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants.<br>The Warrant Agent shall have no duty to verify availability of such shares set aside by the Company.<br><br>The Company or, if appointed, the registrar for the Ordinary Shares (the Registrar) and every subsequent Registrar for any Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of any of the Warrants will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such purpose.<br>The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the Registrar and with every subsequent Registrar for any Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants.<br>The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to instruct from time to time from the Registrar to issue the Ordinary Share certificates required to honor outstanding Warrants upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.<br>The Company will supply such Registrar with duly executed certificates for such purposes.<br>The Company will furnish such Registrar a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto, transmitted to each holder pursuant to Section 13 hereof.<br><br>Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment pursuant to Section 11 hereof to reduce the Exercise Price below the then par value (if any) of the Warrant Shares, the Company will take any commercially reasonable corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel (which may be counsel employed by the Company), be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares at the Exercise Price as so adjusted.<br><br>The Company covenants that all Ordinary Shares which may be issued upon exercise of Warrants will, upon payment of the Exercise Price therefor and issue, be fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof.<br><br><li>SECTION 10.Obtaining Stock Exchange Listings.</li><br>The Company will from time to time take all commercially reasonable actions which may be necessary so that the Warrant Shares, immediately upon their<br>5<br>issuance upon the exercise of Warrants, will be listed on the principal securities exchanges and markets within the United States of America, if any, on which the ADSs are then listed.<br>To the extent that the ADSs are not listed on a national securities exchange or there is no exemption from state blue sky securities laws for the issuance of the Warrant Shares, the Company will take all commercially reasonable actions which may be necessary so that the Warrant Shares are registered in all states in which the holders of the Warrants reside.<br><br><li>SECTION 11.Adjustment of Number of Warrant Shares.</li><br>The number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this Section 11.<br><br><ul><li>(a)Stock Dividends  Split-Ups</li>If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 12 hereof, the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares is increased by a stock dividend payable in Ordinary Shares, or by a split-up of Ordinary Shares, or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to such increase in outstanding Ordinary Shares.<br><br><li>(b)Aggregation of Shares</li>If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of Section 12 hereof, the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of Ordinary Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding Ordinary Shares.<br><br><li>(c)Merger, Reorganization, etc</li>In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (other than a change covered by Section 11(a) or 11(b) hereof or that solely affects the par value of such Ordinary Shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Ordinary Shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Company is dissolved, the Warrant holders shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the Ordinary Shares of the Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the Warrant holder would have received if such Warrant holder had exercised his, her or its Warrant(s) immediately prior to such event; and if any reclassification also results in a change in Ordinary Shares covered by Section 11(a) or 11(b) hereof, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to Sections 11(a), 11(b), and 11(d) hereof and this Section 11(c).<br>The provisions of this Section 11(c) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers.<br><br><li>(d)Extraordinary Dividends</li>If the Company distributes to all holders of its Ordinary Shares any of its assets (including cash) or debt securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase debt securities, assets or other securities of the Company (other than Ordinary Shares), the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:<br>N = N x<br>M<br>M - F<br>where:<br>N = the adjusted number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.<br><br>N = the current number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant.<br><br>M = one third of the Closing Price per ADS on the Business Day immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for such distribution.<br><br>F = the fair market value on the ex-dividend date for such distribution of the assets, securities, options, rights or warrants distributable to one Ordinary Share after taking into account, in the case of any rights,<br>6<br>options or warrants, the consideration required to be paid upon exercise thereof.<br>The Board of Directors (the Board) shall reasonably determine the fair market value in good faith.<br><br>The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.<br><br>This subsection (d) does not apply to any dividends or distributions made in connection with, or as part of, (i) regular quarterly or other periodic dividends; or (ii) any of the actions contemplated by Sections 11(a), 11(b) or 11(e).<br>If any adjustment is made pursuant to this subsection (d) as a result of the issuance of rights, options or warrants and at the end of the period during which any such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all such rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the Warrant shall be immediately readjusted as if F in the above formula was the fair market value on the ex-dividend date for such distribution of the indebtedness or assets actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants divided by the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding on the ex-dividend date for such distribution.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection (d), if M-F in the above formula is less than $1.00, the Company may elect to, or if M-F is a negative number, the Company shall, in lieu of the adjustment otherwise required by this subsection (d), distribute to the holders of the Warrants, upon exercise thereof, the evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants (or the proceeds thereof) which would have been distributed to such holders had such Warrants been exercised immediately prior to the record date for such distribution.<br><br><li>(e)Adjustments To Exercise Price</li>Whenever the number of Ordinary Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided in Sections 11(a) and 11(b) hereof, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.<br><br><li>(f)Form of Warrant</li>The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 11, and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Exercise Price and the same number of shares as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement.<br>However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.<br><br><li>(g)Notices of Changes in Warrant</li>Upon every adjustment of the Exercise Price or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant Agent, which notice shall state the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based.<br>Upon the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c) or 11(e), then, in any such event, the Company shall give written notice to each Warrant holder, at the last address set forth for such holder in the warrant register, of the record date or the effective date of the event.<br>Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such event.<br><br><li>(h)Notice of Certain Transactions</li>In the event that the Company shall propose to (a) offer the holders of its Ordinary Shares rights to subscribe for or to purchase any securities convertible into Ordinary Shares or shares of capital stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (b) issue any rights, options or warrants to the holders of Ordinary Shares entitling them to subscribe for Ordinary Shares or (c) make a tender offer or exchange offer with respect to the Ordinary Shares, the Company shall send to the Warrant holders and file with the Warrant Agent a notice of such proposed action or offer.<br>Such notice shall be mailed to the registered holders at their addresses as they appear in the warrant register, and, shall specify the record date for, or the date such offer or issuance is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of Ordinary Shares, if any such date is to be.<br>Such notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after the Board has determined to take any such action and (x) in the case of any action covered by clause (a) or (b) above at least 10 days prior to the record date for determining the holders of the Ordinary Shares for purposes of such action or (y) in the case of any other such action at least 20 days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of Ordinary Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.<br><br>7<br><ul><li>(i)Other Events</li>If any event occurs as to which the foregoing provisions of this Section 11 are not strictly applicable or, if strictly applicable, would not, in the good faith judgment of the Board, fairly and adequately protect the purchase rights of the registered holders of the Warrants in accordance with the essential intent and principles of such provisions, then the Board shall make such adjustments in the application of such provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as shall be reasonably necessary, in the good faith opinion of the Board, to protect such purchase rights as aforesaid.<br><br></ul></ul><li>SECTION 12.Fractional Interests.</li><br>Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional shares upon exercise of Warrants.<br>If, by reason of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 12, the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round up to the nearest whole number of the Ordinary Shares to be issued to the Warrant holder.<br><br><li>SECTION 13.Notice to Warrant Holders.</li><br>Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11, the Company shall promptly thereafter, and in any event within five days, (i) cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer or principal financial officer of the Company setting forth the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of each Warrant after such adjustment and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculations are based, and (ii) cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage prepaid.<br>Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this Section 13.<br>The Warrant Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.<br>In case:<br><ul><li>(a) the Company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of Ordinary Shares of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares or of any other subscription rights or warrants; or</li><li>(b) the Company shall authorize the distribution to all holders of Ordinary Shares of evidences of its indebtedness or assets (other than regular cash dividends or dividends payable in Ordinary Shares or distributions referred to in subsection (b) of Section 11 hereof); or</li><li>(c) of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the conveyance or transfer of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety, or of any reclassification or change of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), or a tender offer or exchange offer for Ordinary Shares; or</li><li>(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; or</li><li>(e) the Company proposes to take any action not specified above which would require an adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 11 hereof;</li>then the Company shall cause to be filed with the Warrant Agent and shall cause to be given to each of the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register, at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, or as promptly as practicable under the circumstances in the case of events for which there is no record date, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, a written notice stating (i) the date as of which the holders of record of Ordinary Shares to be entitled to receive any such rights, options, warrants or distribution are to be determined, or (ii) the initial expiration date set forth in any tender offer or exchange offer for Ordinary Shares, or (iii) the date on which any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or consummated, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of record of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to exchange such shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.<br>The failure to give the notice required by this Section 13 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution, right, option, warrant, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any action.<br><br>8<br>Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any of the Warrant Certificates shall be construed as conferring upon the holders thereof the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of the meetings of shareholders or the election of directors of the Company or any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the Company.<br><br></ul><li>SECTION 14.Merger, Consolidation or Change of Name of Warrant Agent.</li><br>Any corporation into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust or agency business of the Warrant Agent, shall be the successor to the Warrant Agent hereunder without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor warrant agent under the provisions of Section 16 hereof.<br>In case at the time such successor to the Warrant Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, and in case at that time any of the Warrant Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor to the Warrant Agent may adopt the
