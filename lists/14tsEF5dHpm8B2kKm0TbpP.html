of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account.<br>In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction.<br>These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that becomes subject to the penny stock rules.<br>The Securities are subject to the penny stock rules, and investors may find it more difficult to sell their securities.<br><br>6<br></ul><li>7.Indemnification</li>The Subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and any person, if any, who controls the Company, within the meaning of Section 15 of the
