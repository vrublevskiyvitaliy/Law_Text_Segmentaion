VI<br>INDEMNIFICATION<br><ul><li>Section 1.Nature of Indemnity.</li><br>The Corporation shall indemnify to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter may be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (hereinafter, a Proceeding), whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative, or any appeal in such a Proceeding or any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalities and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection with such Proceeding and any appeal therefrom, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators, provided, however, that except as provided in Section 2 of this Article VI with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part<br>14<br>thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.<br><br><li>Section 2.Recovery of Unpaid Indemnification.</li><br>If a claim under Section 1 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant also shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim.<br>It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.<br>Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.<br><br><li>Section 3.Successful Defense.</li><br>To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Proceeding referred to in Section 1 of this Article VI or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.<br><br><li>Section 4.Preservation of Other Rights.</li><br>The rights to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.<br><br><li>Section 5.Insurance.</li><br>The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her or incurred by him or her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under this Article VI, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors.<br><br>15<br><li>Section 6.Expenses.</li><br>Expenses incurred by any person described in Section 1 of this Article VI in defending a Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of such Proceedings final disposition and without any determination as to the persons ultimate entitlement to indemnification; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by any such person in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of a written affirmation by such person of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under this Article VI and a written undertaking, by or on behalf of such person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.<br><br><li>Section 7.Employees and Agents.</li><br>Persons who are not covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article VI and who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board of Directors.<br>The expenses incurred by such employees and agents may also be paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.<br><br><li>Section 8.Contract Rights.</li><br>The provisions of this Article VI shall be deemed to be a contract right, and any repeal or modification of this Article VI or any such law shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.<br><br><li>Section 9.Severability.</li><br>If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer and any other person indemnified pursuant to this Article VI as to costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br><br><li>Section 10.Appearance as a Witness.</li><br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, the Corporation shall pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director or officer in connection with his or her appearance as a witness or other participation in a Proceeding at a time when he or she is not a named defendant or respondent in the Proceeding.<br><br>ARTICLE VII<br>CAPITAL STOCK<br><ul><li>Section 1.Form.</li><br>Except as otherwise provided in a resolution approved by the Board of Directors, all shares of capital stock of the

signed such certificate(s) or whose facsimile signature(s) have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer(s) of the Corporation.<br>All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified.<br>The name of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the books of the

sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.<br><br><li>Section 4.Fixing a Record Date for Stockholder Meetings.</li><br>In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted<br>17<br>by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting.<br>If no record date is fixed by the
