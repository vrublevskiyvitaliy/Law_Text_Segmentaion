AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP<br>OF<br>EAGLE ROCK ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.<br>THIS AMENDMENT NO.<br>1 TO THE FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF EAGLE ROCK ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P. dated as of [], 2010 (this Amendment No. 1), is entered into by and among Eagle Rock Energy GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as the General Partner and as the lawful attorney-in-fact for the Limited Partners, together with any other Persons who become Partners in the Partnership or parties hereto as provided herein.<br><br>WHEREAS, the General Partner and Limited Partners entered into the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P. on October 27, 2006 (the First Amended and Restated Agreement);<br>WHEREAS, the Partnership has entered into the Securities Purchase and Global Transaction Agreement, dated December 21, 2009, among the Partnership and the other parties thereto, which contemplates, among other things, the distribution of rights and the issuance of warrants by the Partnership; and<br>WHEREAS, this Amendment No. 1 has been approved by a Unit Majority and the General Partner.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Section 13.2 of the First Amended and Restated Agreement, in consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the First Amended and Restated Agreement is hereby amended as follows:<br></ul><ul><li>Section 1.Amendment.</li><br><br><ul><li>(a) Section 1.</li><ul><li>(i) Right Exercised Common Unit means any Common Unit issued by the Partnership upon the exercise of a right to purchase a Common Unit</li><br><li>(ii) Warrant Exercised Common Unit means any Common Unit issued by the Partnership upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase a Common Unit</li><br></ul><li>(b) Section 5.</li>The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner (or a beneficial owner of Partnership Interests held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner)<br>owning a Partnership Interest a separate Capital Account with respect to such Partnership Interest in accordance with the rules of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s).<br>Such Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital Contributions made to the Partnership with respect to such Partnership Interest and (ii) all items of Partnership income and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1, and decreased by (x) the amount of cash or Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b) and allocated with respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 6.1.<br>The Partnership shall follow the proposed noncompensatory option regulations under Proposed Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1, 1.721-2 and 1.761-3 at all times, including when the assets of the Partnership are revalued or any warrant is exercised in accordance with its terms.<br><br><li>(c) Section 5.</li><ul><li>(i) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of services or the conversion of the General Partners Combined Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 11.3(b), the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such issuance.</li>In accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(2), upon any exercise of a warrant, the Capital Account of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property shall immediately after such exercise be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair market value immediately prior to such exercise.<br>Any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (or items thereof) shall first be allocated to the Partners who were the initial holders of a Warrant Exercised Common Unit until the Capital Account in respect of each such Warrant Exercised Common Unit is equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit) if the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, and regardless of whether the operation of this sentence is triggered by the exercise of a warrant, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(c) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized following an event giving rise to the dissolution of the Partnership would have been allocated.<br>If the Unrealized Gain or<br>-2-<br>Unrealized Loss allocated as a result of the exercise of a warrant is not sufficient to cause the Capital Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), then Capital Account balances shall be reallocated between the Partners holding Warrant Exercised Common Units and the Partners holding Common Units (other than Warrant Exercised Common Units) so as to cause the Capital Account of each Warrant Exercised Common Unit to equal the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then Outstanding Common Unit (other than a Warrant Exercised Common Unit), in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3).<br>In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests, or immediately after the exercise of a warrant, shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time.<br>The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines) to arrive at a fair market value for individual properties.<br><br><li>(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 6.1(c) in the same manner as any item of gain or loss actually recognized during such period would have been allocated.</li>In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets (including cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of an actual distribution that is not made pursuant to Section 12.4 or in the case of a deemed distribution, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such method of valuation as it may adopt.<br><br></ul><li>(d) Section 5.</li>Splits, Combinations and Other Pro Rata Distributions.<br><br><ul><li>(a) Subject to Section 5.</li>-3-<br>appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Security to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any such event (but before giving effect to the exercise of any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities distributed in connection with such event), each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit basis (including any Common Unit Arrearage or Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage) or stated as a number of Units (including the number of Subordinated Units that may convert prior to the end of the Subordination Period) are proportionately adjusted.<br><br><li>(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such notice</li>The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities or any options, rights, warrants or appreciation rights relating to any Partnership Securities to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution, subdivision or combination.<br>The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such calculation.<br><br><li>(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the Partnership may issue Certificates to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect such changes</li>If any such combination results in a smaller total number of Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.<br><br><li>(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution, subdivision or combination of Units</li>If a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for the provisions of this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher Unit).<br><br><li>(e) Section 6.</li>Economic Uniformity.<br><ul><li>(A) At the election of the General Partner with respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the termination of the Subordination Period, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership</li>-4-<br>income or gain for such taxable period, after taking into account allocations pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(iii), shall be allocated 100% to each Partner holding Subordinated Units that are Outstanding as of the termination of the Subordination Period (Final Subordinated Units) in the proportion of the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner to the total number of Final Subordinated Units then Outstanding, until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Final Subordinated Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Final Subordinated Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit.<br>The purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital Accounts underlying Final Subordinated Units and the Capital Accounts underlying Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its Affiliates immediately prior to the conversion of such Final Subordinated Units into Common Units.<br>This allocation method for establishing such economic uniformity will be available to the General Partner only if the method for allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Subordinated Units between the transferred and retained Subordinated Units pursuant to Section 5.5(c)(ii) does not otherwise provide such economic uniformity to the Final Subordinated Units.<br><br><li>(B) With respect to any taxable period ending after a right is exercised, all or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period shall be allocated 100% to each Partner who was the initial holder of a Right Exercised Common Unit until each such Partner has been allocated an amount of gross income or gain that increases the Capital Account maintained with respect to such Right Exercised Common Units to an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Right Exercised Common Units held by such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit (other than a Right Exercised Common Unit)</li><br></ul><li>(f) Section 6.</li>For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions, (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax purposes of income (including gross income), gains, losses, deductions, Unrealized Gains or Unrealized Losses, and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code (including, if necessary to accomplish the intent of this Agreement, the finalization of Treasury Regulations that may differ from the Proposed Treasury Regulations relied upon in Section 5.5(d)(i) and Section 6.2(i) hereof) or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or classes thereof).<br>The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 6.2(c) only if such<br>-5-<br>conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.<br><br><li>(g) Section 6.</li>If Capital Account balances are reallocated between the Partners in accordance with Section 5.5(d)(i) hereof and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(4), beginning with the year of reallocation and continuing until the allocations required are fully taken into account, the Partnership shall make corrective allocations (allocations of items of gross income or gain or loss or deduction for federal income tax purposes that do not have a corresponding book allocation) to take into account the Capital Account reallocation, as provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).<br><br></ul></ul><li>Section
