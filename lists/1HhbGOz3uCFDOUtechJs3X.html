Documents</li>The parties shall take any actions and execute any other documents that may be necessary or desirable to the implementation and consummation of this Agreement upon the reasonable request of the other party.<br><br><li>7.3 Fees and Expenses</li>Each party shall be responsible for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement; provided, that NGAS shall reimburse the Holder for an aggregate of up to $75,000 of their reasonable documented out-of-pocket legal expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount shall be paid by NGAS by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing or upon termination of this Agreement so long as such termination did not occur as a result of a material breach by the

for Persons engaged by the Holder) relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby.<br>NGAS shall pay, and hold the Holder harmless against, any liability, loss or expense

provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.<br>Upon determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree on a modification of this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Exchange Document (and without implication that the following is required or applicable), it is the intention of the parties that in no event shall amounts and value paid by NGAS, or payable to or received by the Holder, under the Exchange Documents, including without limitation, any amounts that would be characterized as interest under applicable law (including, without limitation, any applicable Canadian or British Columbia law), exceed amounts permitted under any such applicable law.<br>Accordingly, if any obligation to pay, payment made to the Holder, or collection by the Holder pursuant the Exchange Documents is finally judicially determined to be contrary to any such applicable law, such obligation to pay, payment or collection shall be deemed to have been made by mutual mistake of the Holder and NGAS and such amount shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by the applicable law.<br>Such adjustment shall be effected, to the extent necessary, by reducing or refunding, at the option of the Holder, the amount of interest or any other amounts which would constitute unlawful amounts required to be paid or actually paid to the Holder under the Exchange Documents.<br>For greater certainty, to the extent that any interest, charges, fees, expenses or other amounts required to be paid to or received by the Holder under any of the Exchange Documents or related thereto are held to be within the meaning of interest or another applicable term to otherwise be violative of applicable law, such amounts shall be pro-rated over the period of time to which they relate.<br><br><li>7.5 Entire Agreement</li>This Agreement and the other Exchange Documents represent the entire agreement

Agreement.<br>Without limiting the foregoing, NGAS confirms that the<br>17<br>Holder has made not any commitment or promise or has any other obligation to provide any financing to NGAS, any Subsidiary or otherwise.<br><br><li>7.6 No Oral Modification</li>This Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by NGAS and by the Holder.<br>All waivers relating to any provision of this Agreement must be

Agreement, any of the other Exchange Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in the state of New York.<br>The

process in any manner permitted by law.<br><br><li>EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT</li><br><li>7.10 Counterparts</li>This Agreement may be executed in two or more identical counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party.<br>In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by an e-mail which contains a portable

Agreement is terminated under Section 6 in accordance with the terms thereof, the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants shall survive the Closing.<br>The language used in this

Indemnification</li><br><ul><li>(a) In consideration of the Holders execution and delivery of the Exchange Documents to which it is a party and acquiring the Securities thereunder and in addition to all of NGASs other obligations under the Exchange Documents, NGAS shall defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Holder and each affiliate of the Holder that holds any Securities and all of their shareholders, partners, members, officers, directors, employees and direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Persons agents or other representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the Indemnitees) from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements (the Indemnified Liabilities), incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to (a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by NGAS in any of the Exchange Documents, (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of NGAS contained in any of the Exchange Documents or (c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee by a third party (including for these purposes a derivative action brought on behalf of NGAS) and arising out of or resulting from (i) the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of any of the Exchange Documents, (ii) any disclosure properly made by the Holder pursuant to Section 4.</li>To the extent that the foregoing undertaking by NGAS may be unenforceable for any reason, NGAS shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law.<br><br><li>(b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnitee under this Section 7.</li>In the case of an Indemnitee, legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Indemnitees holding a majority of the then outstanding 2009 Notes.<br>The Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with NGAS in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such Indemnified Liability by NGAS and shall furnish to NGAS all information reasonably available to the Indemnitee which relates to such Indemnified Liability.<br>NGAS shall keep the Indemnitee reasonably apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.<br>NGAS shall not be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that NGAS shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent.<br>NGAS shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all liability in respect to such Indemnified Liability.<br>Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, NGAS shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.<br>The failure to deliver written notice to NGAS within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve NGAS of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 7.14, except to the extent that NGAS is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.<br><br><li>(c) The indemnification required by this Section 7.</li><br><li>(d) The indemnification required by this Section 7.</li><br>19<br></ul><li>7.15 Remedies</li>The Holder and each affiliate of the Holder that holds any Securities shall have all rights and remedies set forth in the Exchange Documents and all rights and remedies which such holders have been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the rights which such holders have under any law.<br>Any Person having any rights under any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security), to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law.<br>Furthermore, NGAS recognizes that in the event that it fails to perform, observe, or discharge any or all of its obligations under any of the Exchange Documents, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Holder.<br>NGAS therefore agrees that the Holder shall be entitled to seek specific performance and/or temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in any such case without the necessity of proving damages and without posting a bond or other security.<br><br><li>7.16 Withdrawal Right</li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in (and without limiting any similar provisions of) the Exchange Documents, whenever the Holder exercises a right, election, demand or option under an Exchange Document and NGAS does not timely perform its related obligations within the periods therein provided, then the Holder may rescind or withdraw, in its sole discretion from time to time upon written notice to NGAS, any relevant notice, demand or election in whole or in part without prejudice to its future actions and rights.<br><br><li>7.17 Payment Set Aside</li>To the extent that NGAS makes a payment or payments to the Holder hereunder or the Holder enforces or exercises its rights hereunder or thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to NGAS, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, foreign, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.<br>Unless otherwise expressly indicated, all dollar amounts referred to in this Agreement and the other Exchange Documents are in United States Dollars (US Dollars), and all amounts owing under this Agreement and all other Exchange Documents shall be paid in US Dollars.<br>All amounts denominated in other currencies shall be converted in the US Dollar equivalent amount in accordance with the Exchange Rate on the date of calculation.<br>Exchange Rate means, in relation to any amount of currency to be converted into US Dollars pursuant to this Agreement, the US Dollar exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the relevant date of calculation.<br><br><li>7.18 Independent Nature of the Holders Obligations and Rights</li>The obligations of the Holder under the Exchange Documents are several and not joint with the obligations of any Other Note Holder under the Other Exchange Documents, and the Holder shall not be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any Other Note Holders under any Other Exchange Documents.<br>Nothing contained herein or in any other Exchange Document, and no action taken by the Holder pursuant hereto or any Other Note Holder pursuant to any Other Exchange Documents, shall be deemed to constitute the Holder or any Other Note Holder as, and NGAS acknowledges that the Holder and the Other Note Holders do not so constitute, a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of group or entity, or create a presumption that the Holder and any Other Note Holder are in any way acting in concert or as a group or entity with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents, the Other Exchange Documents or any matters, and NGAS acknowledges that the Holder and the Other Note Holders are not acting in concert or as a group or entity, and NGAS shall not assert any such claim, with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents and the Other Exchange Documents.<br>The decision of the Holder to acquire the Securities pursuant to the Exchange Documents has been made by the Holder independently of any Other Note Holder.<br>The Holder acknowledges that no Other Note Holder has acted as agent for the Holder in connection with the Holder making its acquisition hereunder and that no Other Note Holder will be acting as agent of the Holder in connection with monitoring the Holders Securities or enforcing its rights under the Exchange Documents.<br>NGAS and the Holder confirm that the Holder has independently participated with NGAS in the negotiation of the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and advisors.<br>The Holder shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of any of the other Exchange Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any Other Note Holder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.<br>To the extent that any of the Other Note Holders and NGAS enter into the same or similar documents, all such matters are solely in the control of NGAS, not the action or decision of the Holder, and<br>20<br>would be solely for the convenience of NGAS and not because it was required or requested to do so by the Holder or any Other Note Holder.<br>For clarification purposes only and without implication that the contrary would otherwise be true, the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Documents include only the transaction between NGAS and the Holder and do not include any other transaction between NGAS and any Other Note Holder.<br><br><li>7.19 Reaffirmation</li>Except as

represents and warrants as of the date hereof and covenants and agrees from and after the date hereof that, except as set forth in the term sheet attached hereto as Exhibit G, none of the terms offered to any Person with respect to any consent, release, amendment, settlement or waiver relating to the terms, conditions and transactions contemplated hereby (each a Settlement Document), is or will be more favorable to such Person than those of the Holder and this Agreement.<br>If, and whenever on or after the date hereof, NGAS enters into a Settlement Document, then (i) NGAS shall provide notice thereof to the Holder immediately following the occurrence thereof and (ii) the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the other Exchange Documents and the Securities (other than any limitations on conversion or exercise set forth therein) shall be, without any further action by the Holder or NGAS, automatically amended and modified in an economically and legally equivalent manner such that the Holder shall receive the benefit of the more favorable terms and/or conditions (as the case may be), provided that upon written notice to NGAS at any time the Holder may elect not to accept the benefit of any such amended or modified term or condition, in which event the term or condition contained in this Agreement or the Securities (as the case may be) shall apply to the Holder as it was in effect immediately prior to such amendment or modification as if such amendment or modification never occurred with respect to the Holder.<br>The provisions of this Section 7.20 shall apply similarly and equally to each Settlement Document.<br><br><li>7.21 Successors and Assigns</li>This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective

way of a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in the 2009 Notes) (unless NGAS is in compliance with the applicable provisions governing Fundamental Transactions set forth in the 2009 Warrants and the 2005 Warrant and the 2009 Warrants).<br>The Holder may assign some or all of its rights hereunder in connection with transfer of any of its Securities without the consent of NGAS, in which event such assignee shall be deemed to be a Holder hereunder with respect to such assigned rights.<br><br><li>7.22 Judgment Currency</li><br><ul><li>(a) If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against the Company in any court in any jurisdiction it becomes necessary to convert into any other currency (such other currency being hereinafter in this Section 7.</li>21<br><ul><li>(i) the date
