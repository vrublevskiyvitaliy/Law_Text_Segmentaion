net income of Bank), then Bank shall promptly notify Borrower stating the reasons therefor.<br>Borrower shall thereafter pay to Bank, upon demand from time to time, as additional consideration<br>25<br>hereunder, such additional amounts as shall fully compensate Bank for such increased cost or reduced amount.<br>A certificate as to any such increased cost or reduced amount, setting forth the calculations therefor, shall be submitted by Bank to Borrower and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount thereof.<br><br>If Bank receives such additional consideration from Borrower pursuant to this Section 10.2, Bank shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts on
