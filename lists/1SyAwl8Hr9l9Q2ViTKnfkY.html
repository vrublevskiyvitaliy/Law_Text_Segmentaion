any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall have the rights of a Purchaser under this Agreement.<br><br>13<br>(2) Each of the Purchasers agrees to the imprinting, so long as is required by this Section 6(a), of a legend on any of the Shares in the following form:<br>THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION

restrictive legend (such date, the Legend Removal Date), deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser or such Purchasers transferee, as applicable, a certificate representing such Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends.<br>The Company may not make any notation on its records or give instructions to any transfer agent of the Company that enlarge the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not be required to effect a removal of a restrictive legend to the extent such legend is required under applicable requirements of the Securities Act, including any rule of the SEC promulgated thereunder, and judicial interpretations thereof.<br><br>14<br>(4) Each of the Purchasers agrees that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates representing Shares as set forth in this Section 6(a)(3)(i) or (ii) is predicated upon the Companys reliance that such Purchaser will sell any Shares pursuant to either the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements, or an exemption therefrom.<br><br><li>(b)Furnishing of Information</li>As long as any Purchaser owns any Shares, the Company covenants to timely file all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act.<br>If

is required for such Purchaser to sell the Shares under Rule 144.<br>The Company further covenants that it will take such further action as the Purchasers may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Purchasers to sell such Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule

that would be integrated with the offer or sale of the Shares in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of the sale of the Shares to the Purchasers.<br>The Company shall conduct its business in a manner so that it will not become subject to registration under the Investment Company Act.<br><br><li>(d)Disclosure; Publicity</li>No Purchaser shall issue any press release

securities laws.<br>If any action shall be brought against any Company Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Company Party shall promptly notify the applicable Purchaser in writing, and such Purchaser shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing.<br>Any Company Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Company Party except to the extent that (A) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by such Purchaser in writing; (B) such Purchaser has failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel reasonably
