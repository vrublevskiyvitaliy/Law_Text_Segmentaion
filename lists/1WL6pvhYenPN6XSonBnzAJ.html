Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and(v) Subscriber shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties made by

order.</li><br><li>(d) AerCap shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, prepare a post-effective amendment to the Share Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus or file any other required document so that the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made.</li><br><li>(e) AerCap shall deliver to Subscriber, without charge, as many copies of the Share Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if requested, all exhibits (including those incorporated by reference), and the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) included in the Share Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as Subscriber reasonably requests.</li>AerCap consents to the use by Subscriber of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection with the offering and resale of the Subject Shares covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in such Share Registration Statement.<br><br><li>(f) AerCap shall use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the Subject Shares under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as Subscriber shall reasonably request, except that AerCap shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where, but for the requirements of this Section 8(f), it would not be obligated to be so qualified, to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction.</li><br><li>(g) AerCap shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Subject Shares covered by the Share Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such

Contribution.</li><br></ul><ul><li>(b) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then AerCap shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate (i) to reflect the relative benefits received (or anticipated to be received) by Austin, on the one hand, and received by Subscriber, on the other hand, from the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement and this Agreement and (ii), if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is unavailable for any reason, to reflect not only the relative benefits, but also the relative fault of AerCap and the indemnified party in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in such expenses, claims, losses, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations</li>Benefits received (or anticipated to be received) by AerCap shall be deemed to be equal to the Transaction Value (as defined in the Engagement Letter) and the aggregate value of the Subject Shares sold to Subscriber under this Agreement, and benefits received by Subscriber shall be deemed to be equal to the Transaction Fee paid to Subscriber.<br>The relative fault of AerCap and the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action or omission.<br>The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 9(b).<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall any indemnified party be responsible under this paragraph for any amounts in excess of the Transaction Fee actually received by Subscriber.<br><br><li>(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 9 shall survive the resale by Subscriber of the Subject Shares</li><br></ul><ul><li>10.Miscellaneous</li><br></ul><ul><li>(a)Further Assurances.</li><br><li>(b)Notices.</li>5<br>requested, postage prepaid, addressed to such party at the address
