bundle one.<br>On one hand, the domestic market has a relatively shorter history data and in the first several years of its establishment, the speculation atmosphere was pregnant, so the market fluctuation is large; on the other hand, presently, the control over the exchange flow under the capital account is strict, plus the particularity of the stock equity separation, so the stock equity risk premium deduced directly from the history data has a low reliability, while in the mature market, owing the long history data, the overall stock equity risk premium on the market could be got from analyzing the history data, so the risk premium of international emerging markets commonly could be decided by the risk premium of the mature market.<br>In this appraisal, the market risk premium Rpm is 7.5%.<br><br>The risk adjustment coefficient<br>According to the operation data statistics in the previous years, the power station has reached power generation capacity stated in the preliminary design report.<br>Its installed capacity is 40,000kW, and its income is stable under the current power generation capacity.<br>With the local governments reconstruction on the power transmission circuit, the local power transmission capability is improved, and its power generation capacity is increased in the rainy season, so that its annual power generation capacity can be improved accordingly.<br>Meanwhile, the coordination of Lishui Hydropower Bureau can improve its peak/valley ratio so as to increase income.<br>Considering the influence of the aforesaid factors on revenue, this appraisal believes that it has certain operation risk.<br>At present, the assets/liabilities ratio of the enterprise is not high and its business finance risk is not high.<br>Whereas the
