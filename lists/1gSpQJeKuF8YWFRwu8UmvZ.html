statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, in each case at the time such became effective under the Securities Act, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,

any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein</li>This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.<br><br><li>(b) Each Holder of securities covered by the Registration Statement severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity</li>This indemnity agreement shall be acknowledged by each Notice Holder that is not Hochschild in such Notice Holders Notice and Questionnaire and shall be in addition to any liability that any such Notice Holder may otherwise have.<br><br>10<br><li>(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses or otherwise materially prejudices the indemnifying party; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above</li>The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.<br>Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel (including one local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.<br>An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.<br><br><li>(d) If the indemnification to which an indemnified party is entitled under this Section 7 is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient although applicable in accordance with its terms to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses,</li>11<br>liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.<br><br>The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Holders of the Registrable Securities on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied in writing by the Company or in writing by the Holder of the Registrable Securities and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.<br><br>The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(d).<br>The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include any out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.<br><br>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Holder of any Registrable Securities shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received from the sale of the Registrable Securities by such Holder of Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder of Registrable Securities has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.<br><br>No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br><br>For purposes of this Section 7(d), each person, if any, who controls Hochschild or any Holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as Hochschild or such Holder, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.<br><br>12<br><li>(e) The provisions of this Section 7 shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 7, and shall survive the sale by a Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement</li><br></ul><li>SECTION 8.Miscellaneous</li><br><ul><li>(a) Successors and Assigns</li>Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided however that this Agreement may be assigned by the Holder in connection with the transfer of all, but not less than all, of the Registrable Securities to any Affiliate of the Holder.<br>Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
