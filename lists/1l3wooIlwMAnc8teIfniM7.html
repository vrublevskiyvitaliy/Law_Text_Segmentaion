that each 60 shares of IDEH common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date (the Old Shares) will be automatically converted into one (1) share of IDEH common stock (the New Shares), reducing the number of outstanding shares of its common stock to approximately 591,334 shares, subject to rounding.<br>Fractional shares will be rounded up.<br><br><li>(b)IDEHs obligation to effect a
