Restated April 2007]<br>Page 9<br>material fact required to be stated in the registration statement or prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission is contained in or omitted from any information or affidavit the holder furnished in writing, or resulting from the holders failure to deliver a copy of the registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to any purchaser after the Company has furnished the holder with a sufficient number of copies of the relevant documents; provided, however, that the obligations of any holder of Registrable Securities hereunder will be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such holder of the sale of securities pursuant to the applicable registration statement as contemplated herein.<br><br><li>(c)Indemnification Proceedings</li>Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement will (i) give prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification, and (ii) unless in the indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest may exist between the indemnified and indemnifying parties with respect to the claim, permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of the claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.<br>If the indemnifying party does not assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement made without its consent (but that consent may not be unreasonably withheld).<br>No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or will enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term the claimants or plaintiffs release of the indemnified party from all liability concerning the claim or litigation.<br>An indemnifying party who is not entitled to or elects not to assume the defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by the indemnifying party with respect to the claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between the indemnified party and any other indemnified party with respect to the claim, in which event the indemnifying party will be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of additional counsel.<br><br><li>(d)Contribution to Joint Liability</li>In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any holder of Registrable Securities exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling Person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 8 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact this Section 8 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling holder or any such controlling Person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 8; then, and in each such case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities that they may be subject to (after contribution to others) in such proportion so that such holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its Registered Securities offered by the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such registration statement, and the Company is responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that in any such case, (A) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registered Securities offered by it pursuant to such registration statement; and (B) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br><br></ul><li>Section 9.Rule 144 and Rule 144A; Company Obligations.</li><br>If the Company files a registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act or Section 12 of the Exchange Act, the Company covenants that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any holder of Registrable<br>SPS Registration Rights Agreement [Amended and Restated April 2007]<br>Page 10<br>Securities, make publicly available other information), and it will take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities reasonably may request, all to the extent required from time to time, to enable the holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act as amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.<br>Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities, the Company will deliver to the holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with Rule 144 or any successor rule requirements.<br>The Company also covenants that it will provide all such information and it will take such further action as any holder of Registrable Securities reasonably may request to enable the holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as amended from time to time, or any successor rule requirements.<br><br><li>Section 10.Participation in Underwritten Registrations.</li><br>No Person may participate in any underwritten registration without (a) agreeing to sell securities on the basis provided in underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (the holders of the Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 3(d) and the Company in a Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 4(e)), and (b) completing and executing all questionnaires, powers of attorneys, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required by the underwriting arrangements.<br><br><li>Section 11.Miscellaneous.</li><br><br><ul><li>(a)Adjustments Affecting Securities</li>The Company will

outstanding Series B and Series C Preferred Stock (taken together as a single class on an as-if converted to Common Stock basis).<br><br><li>(c)Attorneys Fees</li>In any legal action or proceeding brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses, charges, court costs, and attorneys fees in addition to any other available remedy at law or in equity.<br><br><li>(d)Benefit of Parties; Assignability</li>All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns, including without limitation all subsequent holders of securities entitled to the benefits of this Agreement who agree in writing to become bound by the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, the Company may not delegate its responsibilities or assign its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the holders of at least 66.67% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series.<br><br><li>(e)Cooperation</li>The parties agree that after execution of this Agreement they will from time to time, upon the request of any other party and without other consideration, execute, acknowledge, and deliver in proper form any further instruments and take such other action as any other party may reasonably require to carry out effectively the intent of this Agreement.<br><br><li>(f)Cumulative Remedies and Survival</li>The rights and remedies specified in this Agreement will not be exclusive of any other right or remedy and are cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise that may be available to the Investors.<br><br>SPS Registration Rights Agreement [Amended and Restated April 2007]<br>Page 11<br><li>(g)Counterparts</li>This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature and

transactions and agreements contemplated hereby, notwithstanding any states choice of law rules to the contrary.<br><br></ul><li>(j)Interpretation</li>The terms and conditions of this Agreement represent the results of bargaining and negotiations among the parties, each of which has the opportunity to be represented by counsel of its own selection, and none of which has acted under duress or

accordance with their usual and customary meanings and the parties hereby expressly waive and disclaim in connection with the interpretation and construction hereof any rule of law or procedures requiring otherwise, specifically including but not limited to any rule of law to the effect that ambiguous or conflicting terms or conditions contained herein will be interpreted or construed against
