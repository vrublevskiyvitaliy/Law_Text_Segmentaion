the extent (but only to the extent) that the Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the Maximum Percentage) of the Common Shares.<br>To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether this Note shall be convertible (vis--vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by the Holder) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be).<br>No prior inability to convert this Note, or to issue Common Shares, pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility.<br>For

Market Regulation</li>The Company shall not be obligated to issue Common Shares upon conversion of this Note or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Note to the extent (and only to the extent) the issuance of such Common Shares would exceed the difference (as calculated immediately following the Exchange Date) between (x) the aggregate number of Common Shares which the Company may issue upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the Notes and Warrants or as payment of any Installment Amount hereunder or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Notes and Warrants together with the Exchange Shares (as defined in the Exchange Agreement) without breaching the<br>4<br>Companys obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market and (y) the number of Exchange Shares issued pursuant to any Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Cap), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its shareholders as required by the applicable rules of such Principal Market for issuances of Common Shares in excess of such amount or (B) a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.<br>Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreements (the Purchasers) shall be issued in the aggregate, upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of Notes or Warrants, or as payment of any Installment Amount hereunder or otherwise hereunder, Common Shares in an amount greater than the product of the Exchange Cap multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the principal amount of Notes issued to a Purchaser pursuant to the Exchange Agreements and outstanding on the Exchange Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of all Notes issued to the Purchasers pursuant to the Exchange Agreements and outstanding on the Exchange Date (with respect to each Purchaser, the Exchange Cap Allocation).<br>In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchasers Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee.<br>In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any Warrants to any transferee, such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation shall not be transferred with such Warrant to such transferee unless such Purchaser delivers written notice to the Company specifying (x) the identity of such transferee and (y) the amount of such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation being transferred to such transferee.<br>In the event that any holder of Notes on any given date shall convert all of such holders Notes into a number of Common Shares, which together with the number of Common Shares actually issued to such holder in connection with the Notes and Warrants of such holder on or prior to such date and any Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants of such holder as of such date, in the aggregate, is less than such holders Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holders Exchange Cap Allocation and the sum of the number of Common Shares (w) actually issued upon conversion of, or otherwise in connection with, the Notes of such holder on or prior to such date, (y) actually issued upon exercise of the Warrants of such holder on or prior to such date and (y) issuable upon exercise of the Warrants of such holder as of such date shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then held by each such holder.<br><br><li>(iii) Settlement Upon Conversion</li><br>(1) General.<br>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Company has delivered a written notice (a Settlement Upon Conversion Election Notice) to the Holder at least five (5) Trading Days prior to the applicable Conversion Date (a

lieu of the Companys obligations to deliver any such Settlement Upon Conversion Election Shares hereunder to the Holder in any conversion under this Note (such number of Settlement Upon Conversion Election Shares in such conversion, the Settlement Upon Conversion Shares), the Company shall, by wire transfer of U.S. dollars in immediately available funds to the account designated by the Holder, pay cash to the Holder in an amount (the Settlement Upon Conversion Amount) equal to product of (x) the number of Settlement Upon Conversion Shares in such conversion and (y) the applicable Settlement Upon Conversion Market Price.<br>For the purpose of this Section 3(d)(iii), as of the Original Issuance Date the Company shall be deemed to have properly delivered a Settlement Upon Conversion Election Notice electing to settle in cash pursuant to this Section 3(d)(iii) any conversion obligations of the Company with respect to the Holder, which would result in the issuance of Common Shares to the Holder in excess of such Holders Exchange Cap Allocation.<br>Subject to the five (5) Trading Day period prior to effectiveness set forth above, any Settlement Upon Conversion Election Notice may be revoked or amended by the Company at any time.<br><br>5<br>(2) Pro Rata Settlement Upon Conversion; Disputes.<br>If the Company delivers a Settlement Upon Conversion Election Notice to the Holder (or changes, revokes or amends any previous Settlement Upon Conversion Election Notice with respect to this Note) and elects or withdraws any election, in whole or in part, to effect a Settlement Upon Conversion with respect to all or any part of the Principal of this Note submitted for conversion pursuant to any Conversion Notice delivered on or after the subsequent Settlement Upon Conversion Notice Effective Date then it must simultaneously take the same action in the same proportion with respect to the Other Notes.<br>In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one holder of Notes for the same Conversion Date and the Company can pay the Settlement Upon Conversion Amount with respect to some, but not all, of such portions of the Notes submitted for Settlement Upon Conversion, the Company shall pay with a Settlement Upon Conversion from each holder of Notes electing to have Notes converted on such date a pro rata amount of such holders portion of its Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all Notes submitted for conversion on such date.<br>In the event of a dispute as to the Settlement Upon Conversion Amount payable to the Holder in connection with a Settlement Upon Conversion of this Note, the Company shall pay to the Holder such portion of the Settlement Upon Conversion Amount not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 23.<br><br>(4) RIGHTS UPON EVENT OF

Holder in accordance with Section 5(b) below.<br>Upon the occurrence of any Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.<br>Upon consummation of the Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to the Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion or redemption of this Note at any time after the consummation of the Assumption Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of the Companys Common Shares (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) issuable upon the conversion or redemption of the Notes prior to such Assumption Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Note.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, but except with respect to an Assumption Fundamental Transaction in which the Company does not survive the consummation thereof, the Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 5(a) to permit the Assumption Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of this Note.<br>The provisions of this Section shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this Note.<br><br><li>(b)Redemption Right</li>No sooner than fifteen (15) days nor later than (I) ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (II) the earlier to occur of (A) one (1) Trading Day after the Company receives notice or otherwise has actual knowledge of any pending or consummated Involuntary Change of Control or (B) five (5) Trading Days after the consummation of any Involuntary Change of Control, but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder (a Change of Control Notice).<br>At any time and from time to time during the period commencing on the earlier to occur of (x) any oral or written agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which upon consummation of the transaction contemplated thereby would reasonably be expected to result in a Change of Control and (y) the Holders receipt of a Change of Control Notice and ending on the date (the Change of Control Redemption Right Termination Date) that is twenty (20) Trading Days after either (A) the date of the consummation of such Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (B) the later of (I) the date of the consummation of such Involuntary Change of Control and (II) the date of the Holders receipt of a Change of Control Notice with respect to such Involuntary Change of Control, the Holder may require the Company to redeem all or any portion of this Note by delivering written notice thereof (a Change of Control Redemption Notice) to the Company, which Change of Control Redemption Notice shall indicate the Conversion Amount the Holder is electing to require the Company<br>8<br>to redeem.<br>Any portion of this Note required to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be redeemed by the Company in cash at a price equal to 110% of the sum of (1) the Conversion Amount being redeemed and (2) the amount of any accrued and unpaid Interest thereon and Late Charges, if any, on such Conversion Amount and Interest through the applicable redemption date (the Change of Control Redemption Price).<br>Redemptions required by this Section 5 shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 12 and, to the extent such Change of Control Redemption Price is required to be paid to the Holder on or prior to the consummation of such Change of Control in accordance with this Section 5(b) or Section 12, shall have priority to payments to shareholders in connection with such Change of Control.<br>To the extent redemptions required by this Section 5(b) are deemed or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prepayments of the Note by the Company, such redemptions shall be deemed to be voluntary prepayments consented to by the Holder in accordance with the last sentence of Section 1 hereof.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5, but subject to Section 3(d), until the Change of Control Redemption Price (together with any interest thereon) is paid in full, the Conversion Amount submitted for redemption under this Section 5(b) (together with any interest thereon) may be converted, in whole or in part, by the Holder into Common Shares, or in the event the Conversion Date is after the consummation of the Change of Control, shares or equity interests of the Successor Entity substantially equivalent to the Companys Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.<br>In the event of a partial redemption of this Note pursuant hereto, the principal amount redeemed shall be deducted from the Installment Amounts relating to the applicable Installment Dates as set forth as specified by the Holder in the Change of Control Redemption Notice.<br>The parties hereto agree that in the event of the Companys redemption of any portion of the Note under this Section 5(b), the Holders damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the Holder.<br>Accordingly, any Change of Control redemption premium due under this Section 5(b) is intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the Holders actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.<br><br><li>(c)Adjustment to the Conversion Rate Upon a Change of Control</li><br><ul><li>(i) In connection with a Change of Control, if the Holder converts its Note at any time beginning on the date of the Change of Control Notice and ending either (x) at the close of business on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of the consummation of such Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (y) at the close of business on the Change of Control Redemption Right Termination Date with respect to any Involuntary Change of Control, the Company will increase the Conversion Rate per $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted by a number of additional shares (the Additional Shares) for such Note as described in Section 5(c)(ii) hereof; provided that (A) such increase in the Conversion Rate shall not take place if such Change of Control is not consummated, (B) with respect to an Involuntary Change of Control that is consummated prior to the Holders receipt of the Change of Control Notice, the Company shall issue Common Shares at the Conversion Rate (including such increase) on the third (3rd) Trading Day after the Conversion Date and (C) with respect to any Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control that is consummated prior to the Holders receipt of the Change of Control Notice), the Company shall (I) issue Common Shares at the Conversion Rate (not including such increase) on the earlier to occur of (X) the third (3rd) Trading Day after the Conversion Date and (Y) the time immediately prior to such Change of Control and (II) issue such Additional Shares at the time immediately prior to such Change of Control; provided, that if the issuance of any Additional Shares would cause the Holder or any of its affiliates to beneficially own Common Shares (or common stock of the Public Successor Entity or other issuer upon the consummation of the Change of Control) in excess of the Maximum Percentage (a Maximum Percentage Event), the Holder shall have the right, exercisable by the delivery of one or more written notices to the Company, to cause the Company to alternatively issue to the Holder such Additional Shares (or the cash, securities and/or other consideration to be issued in exchange for such Additional Shares in such Change of Control, if applicable), or such portion thereof as set forth in the applicable notice, on or prior to the third (3rd) Trading Day after the Holder delivers the applicable notice to the Company (or the Public Successor Entity or other issuer, as applicable) that the issuance of such Additional Shares (or the cash, securities and/or other consideration to be issued in exchange for such Additional Shares in such Change of

number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of this Note) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holders right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such Common Shares as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum

which holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Shares (a Corporate Event), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of this Note, at the Holders option, in lieu of the Common Shares otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of Common Shares in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as the Holder would have been entitled to receive had this Note initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to Common Shares) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate.<br>Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders.<br>The provisions of this Section shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of this Note.<br><br>(7)RIGHTS UPON ISSUANCE OF OTHER SECURITIES<br><ul><li>(a)Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Shares</li>If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any share split, share dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced.<br>If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse share split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.<br><br>(8)COMPANY INSTALLMENT

notice to the Holder, pay the Installment Amount in cash by redeeming such Installment Amount (a Company Redemption) or by any combination of a Company Conversion and a Company Redemption so long as all of the outstanding applicable Installment Amount shall be converted and/or redeemed by the Company on the applicable Installment Date, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not effect a Company Conversion of any Installment Amount under this Section in excess of the Holder Pro Rata Amount of the applicable Installment Volume Limitation.<br>At or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York time on the tenth (10th) Trading Day prior to each Installment Date (each, an Installment Notice Due Time), the Company shall deliver written notice (each, a Company Installment Notice and the date all of the holders receive such notice is referred to as to the Company Installment Notice Date), to each holder of Notes which Company Installment Notice shall (i) either (A) confirm that the applicable Installment Amount of such holders Note shall be converted in whole pursuant to a Company Conversion (such amount to be converted, the Company Conversion Amount) or (B) (1) state that the Company elects to redeem, or is required to redeem in accordance with the provisions of the Notes, in whole or in part, the applicable Installment Amount pursuant to a Company Redemption and (2) specify the portion (including Interest and Late Charges, if any, on such amount and Interest) which the Company elects or is required to redeem pursuant to a Company Redemption (such amount to be redeemed, the Company Redemption Amount) and the portion (including Interest and Late Charges, if any, on such amount and Interest), if any,

Installment Amount and (ii) if the Installment Amount is to be paid, in whole or in part, pursuant to a Company Conversion, certify that the Equity Conditions have been satisfied as of the date of the Company Installment Notice.<br>Each Company Installment Notice shall be irrevocable.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if on or prior to the tenth (10th) Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Installment Date the Holder has not delivered a written notice to the Company (a Maximum Percentage Violation Notice) that the number of Common Shares to be issued to the Holder on the next Installment Date (assuming for calculation purposes only that 100% of the Installment Amount (or such lesser amount as set forth in a Company Installment Notice for such next Installment Date delivered to the Holder prior to the date of such Maximum Percentage Violation Notice) will be converted pursuant to a Company Conversion at the Maximum Percentage Violation Price) would result in a violation of the provisions of Section 3(d) of this Note, the Holder shall be deemed to have represented to the Company that after giving effect to such issuance of Common Shares to the Holder pursuant to such Installment Notice, the Holder (together with its affiliates) will not have<br>11<br>beneficial ownership (together with the beneficial ownership of such Persons affiliates) of a number of Common Shares which exceeds the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Note) of the total outstanding Common Shares of the Company as determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(d) of the Note and (ii) upon the Companys receipt of a Maximum Percentage Violation Notice from the Holder on or prior to the tenth (10th) Trading Day immediately prior to the applicable Installment Date, the Company Redemption Amount shall automatically be increased to reflect the redemption of such portion of the Company Conversion Amount on the applicable Installment Date corresponding to such number of Common Shares that if issued to the Holder in a Company Conversion would result in a violation of the provisions of Section 3(d) of this Note.<br>If the Company does not timely deliver a Company Installment Notice in accordance with this Section 8, then the Company shall be deemed to have delivered an irrevocable Company Installment Notice confirming a Company Conversion and shall be deemed to have certified that the Equity Conditions in connection with any such conversion have been satisfied.<br>Except as expressly provided in this Section 8(a), the Company shall convert and/or redeem the applicable Installment Amount of this Note pursuant to this Section 8 and the corresponding Installment Amounts of the Other Notes pursuant to the corresponding provisions of the Other Notes in the same ratio of the Installment Amount being converted and/or redeemed hereunder.<br>The Company Conversion Amount (whether set forth in the Company Installment Notice or by operation of this Section 8) shall be converted in accordance with Section 8(b) and the Company Redemption Amount shall be redeemed in accordance with Section 8(c).<br><br><li>(b)Mechanics of Company

deliver to the Holder a certificate for, a number of Common Shares equal to the quotient of (A) such Company Conversion Amount divided by (B) the Initial Company Conversion Price (the Pre-Installment Conversion Shares).</li>On the Trading Day immediately after the end of the Company Conversion Measuring Period (the Installment Settlement Date), the Company shall, or shall cause the Transfer Agent to, deliver to the Holders account with DTC, or issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate for, a number of additional Common Shares, if any, equal to the Installment Balance Conversion Shares.<br>If an Event of Default occurs during any applicable Company Conversion Measuring Period and the Holder elects an Event of Default Redemption in accordance with Section 4(b), then, at the Holders option, either (1) the Holder, upon receipt of the Event of Default Redemption Price (which Conversion Amount in such Event of Default Redemption includes the Company Conversion Amount represented by Pre-Installment Conversion Shares), shall return an amount of Common Shares to the Company equal to the number of Pre-Installment Conversion Shares delivered by the Company to the Holder in connection with the applicable Installment Date or (2) the Conversion Amount used to calculate the Event of Default Redemption Price shall be reduced by the product of (x) the Company Conversion Amount applicable to such Installment Date multiplied by (y) the Conversion Share Ratio.<br><br><li>(ii) If there is an Equity Conditions Failure or the Installment Volume Limitation is exceeded at any time prior to the Installment Date or the Installment Settlement Date, as applicable, then at the option of the Holder designated in writing to the Company, the Holder may require the Company to do either of the following (or may elect to do (A) in part and (B) in part): (A) the Company shall redeem all or any part designated by the Holder of the unconverted Company Conversion Amount in cash (such designated amount is referred to as the First Redemption Amount) on such Installment Date or Installment Settlement Date, as applicable, and the Company shall pay to the Holder on such Installment Date, by wire transfer of U.S. Dollars and immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to (x) if an applicable Equity Conditions Failure is due to the occurrence of an Event of Default, 125% or (y) otherwise, 100% of such First Redemption Amount, and/or (B) the Company Conversion shall be null and void with respect to all or any part designated by the Holder of the unconverted Company Conversion Amount and the Holder shall be entitled to all the rights of a holder of this Note with respect to such amount of the Company Conversion Amount; provided, however, that the Conversion Price solely for such unconverted Company Conversion Amount (and not for any other portion of the then outstanding Conversion Amount) shall thereafter be adjusted to equal the lesser of (1) the Company Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Holder voided the Company Conversion and (2) the Company Conversion Price as would be in effect for a Company Conversion on the date on which the Holder delivers a Conversion Notice relating thereto.</li>In the event the Holder elects to require payment of the First Redemption Amount upon an Equity Conditions Failure following the Installment Date, at the Holders option, either (x) the Holder shall, upon receipt of a First Redemption Amount (which amount includes the<br>12<br>Company Conversion Amount represented by Pre-Installment Conversion Shares), shall return an amount of Common Shares to the Company equal to the number of Pre-Installment Conversion Shares delivered by the Company to the Holder in connection with the applicable Installment Date (the Returned Common Shares) or (y) the Holder shall not deliver such Returned Common Shares to the Company and any related First Redemption Amount shall be reduced by the product of (I) the Company Conversion Amount applicable to such Installment Date multiplied by (II) the Conversion Share Ratio.<br>If the Company fails to redeem any First Redemption Amount on or before the applicable Installment Date or Installment Settlement Date, as applicable, by payment of such amount on the applicable Installment Date or Installment Settlement Date, as applicable, then the Holder shall have the rights set forth in Section 12(a) as if the Company failed to pay the applicable Company Redemption Price and all other rights under this Note (including, without limitation, such failure constituting an Event of Default described in Section 4(a)(x)).<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(b), but subject to 3(d), until the Company delivers Common Shares representing the Company Conversion Amount to the Holder, the Company Conversion Amount may be converted by the Holder into Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.<br>In the event that the Holder elects to convert the Company Conversion Amount prior to the applicable Installment Date as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company Conversion Amount so

Installment Redemption Price) equal to 100% of the Company Redemption Amount.<br>If the Company fails to redeem the Company Redemption Amount on the applicable Installment Date by payment of the Company Installment Redemption Price on such date, then at the option of the Holder designated in writing to the Company (any such designation shall be deemed a Conversion Notice pursuant to Section 3(c) for purposes of this Note), the Holder may require the Company to convert all or any part of the Company Redemption Amount at the Company Conversion Price.<br>Conversions required by this Section 8(c) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(c).<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(c), but subject to Section 3(d), until the Company Installment
