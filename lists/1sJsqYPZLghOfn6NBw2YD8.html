Rights.<br>The provisions of this Article V shall be deemed to be a contract right between the corporation and each director or officer who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article V

affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or proceeding then existing.<br><br>Section 8 Merger or Consolidation.<br>For purposes of this Article V, references to the corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent<br>10<br>corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger
