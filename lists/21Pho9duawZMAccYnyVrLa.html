over-the-counter bulletin board and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at least two market makers to register with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc</li>("NASD") as such with respect to such registrable securities; provided, however, that the Investor acknowledges that the Company does not currently meet the requirements for listing on a national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Small Cap Market pursuant to (i) or (ii) and that nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Company to pursue such qualification until such time as the Company satisfies such requirements for a period of not less than forty-five (45) days:<br>5<br><li>(k) Provide a transfer agent for the Registrable Securities not later than the Subscription Date of the Registration Statement;</li><li>(l) Cooperate with the Investor to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates for the Registrable Securities to be offered

requested by the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement hereunder; and</li><li>(c) The Investor agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2(g) or 2(h) above, the Investor will immediately discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement

any registration rights with respect to any of its securities to any person.<br>Except as otherwise provided for in this Section 4, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the written consent of Investor, the Company shall not grant to any person the right to request the Company to Register any securities of the Company under the Securities Act unless the rights so granted are subject in all respects to the prior rights in full of Investor set forth herein, and are not otherwise in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.<br><br></ul><li>5.Indemnification</li>After Registrable Securities are included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:<br><ul><li>(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless, the Investor, the directors, if any, of such Investor, the officers, if any, of such Investor, each person, if any, who controls the Investor within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an "Indemnified Person"), against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (joint or several) incurred (collectively, "Claims") to which any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Claims (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereof or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus if used prior to the Subscription Date of such Registration Statement, or contained in the final prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if the Company files any amendment thereof or supplement thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements therein were made, not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law (the matters in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) being collectively referred to as "Violations")</li>The Company shall<br>7<br>reimburse the Investor, promptly as such expenses are incurred and are due and payable, for any reasonable legal fees or other reasonable expenses incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 5(a) shall not (i) apply to any Claims arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof or supplement thereto, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof; (ii) with respect to any preliminary prospectus, inure to the benefit of any such person from whom the person asserting any such Claim purchased the Registrable Securities that are the subject thereof (or to the benefit of any person controlling such person) if the untrue statement or omission of material fact contained in the preliminary prospectus was corrected in the prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, if such prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof; (iii) be available to the extent such Claim is based on a failure of the Investor to deliver or cause to be delivered the prospectus made available by the Company; or (iv) apply to amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.<br>The Investor will indemnify the Company, its officers, directors and agents (including legal counsel) against any claims arising out of or based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by or on behalf of such Investor, expressly for use in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, subject to such limitations and conditions set forth in the previous sentence.<br>Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party.<br><br><li>(b) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such Indemnified Person shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 5, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding</li>In such event, the Company shall pay for only one separate legal counsel for the Investor selected by the Investor.<br>The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person under this Section 5, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.<br>The<br>8<br>indemnification required by this Section 5 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as such expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred and is due and payable.<br><br></ul><li>6.Contribution</li>To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 5 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that (a) no contribution shall be made under circumstances where the maker would not have been liable for indemnification under the fault standards set forth in Section 5; (b) no seller of Registrable Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any seller of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and (c) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.<br><br><li>7.Reports under Exchange Act</li>With a view to making available to the Investor the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investor to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration ("Rule 144"), the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:<br><ul><li>(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;</li><li>(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act;</li><li>(c) furnish to the Investor so long as the Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, (i) a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company solely if unavailable by EDGAR, and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration; and</li><li>(d) at the request of any Investor of Registrable Securities, give its Transfer Agent irrevocable instructions (supported by an opinion of Company counsel, if required or requested by the Transfer Agent) to the effect that, upon the Transfer Agents receipt from such Investor of:</li><ul><li>(i) a certificate (a Rule 144 Certificate) certifying (A) that such Investor has held the shares of Registrable Securities which the Investor proposes to sell (the Securities Being Sold) for a period of not less than (1) year and (B) as to such other matters as may be appropriate in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and</li>9<br><li>(ii) an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Company (for which purposes it is agreed that the initial Investors Counsel shall be deemed acceptable if such opinion is not given by Company Counsel) that, based on the Rule 144 Certificate, Securities Being Sold may be sold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, even in the absence of an effective Registration Statement,</li>the Transfer Agent is to effect the transfer of the Securities Being Sold and issue to the buyer(s) or transferee(s) thereof one or more stock certificates representing the transferred Securities Being Sold without any restrictive legend and without recording any restrictions on the transferability of such shares on the Transfer Agents books and records (except to the extent any such legend or restriction results from facts other than the identity of the Investor, as the seller or transferor thereof, or the status, including any relevant legends or restrictions, of the shares of the Securities Being Sold while held by the Investor).<br>If the Transfer Agent requires any additional documentation at the time of the transfer, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered all such reasonable additional documentation as may be necessary to effectuate the issuance of an unlegended certificate.<br><br></ul></ul><li>8.Miscellaneous</li><br><ul><li>(a)Registered Owners</li>A person or entity is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such person or entity owns of record such Registrable Securities.<br>If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more persons or entities with respect to the same Registrable

rights of each of the parties under this Agreement are cumulative.<br>The rights of each of the parties hereunder shall not be capable of being waived or varied other than by an express waiver or

exercise of any of such rights shall not preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other such right.<br>No act or course of conduct or negotiation on the part of any party shall in any way
