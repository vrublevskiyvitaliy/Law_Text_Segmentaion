provided in order to protect against the results of further exchange rate fluctuations to the extent reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be necessary.<br><br><li>(d) The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to

in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, but without reduction of the Alternative Currency Sublimit.</li><br></ul><li>2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments</li>The Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate

the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments as reduced, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Designated Borrower Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments as reduced, such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.<br>The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments.<br>The amount of any such Aggregate Commitment reduction shall not be applied to the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Designated Borrower Sublimit or the Swing Line Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Company.<br>Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be<br>51<br>applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage.<br>All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate

fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee rate shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest or fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation hereunder and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields</li><br></ul><ul><li>2.09 Fees</li>In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i)and (j)of Section 2.03:<br><ul><li>(a) Commitment Fee</li>The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.17.<br>The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Commitment Fee Period,

computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Revolving Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice.<br>Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day.<br>Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.<br><br><li>(b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Company or for any other reason, the Company or the Lenders determine that (i)(A) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any</li>53<br>applicable date was

to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders, the applicable L/C Issuer or the applicable Existing L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any Existing L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period; and (ii)(A) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (B) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in lower pricing for such period, the Applicable Rate shall be adjusted as of the date of receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Compliance Certificate reflecting such proper calculation.<br>This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any Existing L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(i) or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII.<br>The Borrowers obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the

maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.</li>The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon.<br>Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.<br>In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of

Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.<br>Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the<br>54<br>Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.<br>Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein.<br>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.<br>If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.<br>The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office.<br>All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.<br>If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.<br><br><li>(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.</li>Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Revolving Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.<br>In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Revolving Borrowing.<br>If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period.<br>If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the<br>55<br>amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing.<br>Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.<br><br></ul></ul><ul><li>(ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent</li>Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, any L/C Issuer or any Existing L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, such L/C Issuer or such Existing L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due.<br>In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, the applicable L/C Issuer or the applicable Existing L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, such L/C Issuer or such Existing L/C Issuer, as applicable, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.<br><br>A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b)shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.<br><br></ul><ul><li>(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent</li>If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.<br><br><li>(d) Obligations of Lenders Several</li>The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint.<br>The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).<br><br><li>(e) Funding Source</li>Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.<br><br></ul><ul><li>2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders</li>If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount<br>56<br>of such Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:<br><ul><li>(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and</li><li>(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral (and proceeds thereof) in respect of obligations relating to Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans (including related Lender participation obligations) provided for in Section 2.</li><br>Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.<br><br></ul><li>2.14 Designated Borrowers</li><br><ul><li>(a) Effective as of the Initial Funding Date, each of

counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of Exhibit H (a Designated Borrower Request and Assumption Agreement); provided, however, that the Company may not have more than five (5) Designated Borrowers at any time; and provided further that no Subsidiary organized under the Laws of Canada may become a Designated Borrower</li>The parties

information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their reasonable discretion and consistent with the requirement of Article IV, and Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require.<br>If the Administrative Agent and each Lender approve in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) that an Applicant Borrower shall be entitled to receive Loans hereunder, then promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit I (a Designated Borrower Notice) to the Company and the Lenders specifying the effective date upon which the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees

Borrower.<br><br>58<br><li>(e) The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 15 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrowers status as such, provided that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or other amounts

whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase.<br>Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.<br><br><li>(c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders</li>The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and each Lender of the Lenders responses to each request made hereunder.<br>To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.<br><br><li>(d) Increase Effective Date and Allocations</li>If the Aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Company shall determine the effective date (the Increase Effective Date) and the final allocation of such increase.<br>The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date.<br>No

banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost

Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or

the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.<br>Upon receipt of such notice, each Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing
