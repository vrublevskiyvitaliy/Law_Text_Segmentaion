of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are

thereof, or in the Prospectus, or in any Prospectus Supplement, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a

omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Investor specifically for inclusion therein.<br>Anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action effected without its consent.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 5.02 Indemnification by the Investor</li>The Investor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing

referred to in the foregoing indemnity.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 5.03 Notice of Claim</li>Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Article V of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Article V, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from liability under Section 5.01 or Section 5.02 above unless and to the extent the indemnifying party did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses or otherwise results in a material impairment of the indemnifying partys ability to defend.<br>In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 5.01 above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Company, and, in the case of parties

parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related

determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Investor on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.<br>The Company and the Investor agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.<br>The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Article V shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.04, the Investor shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Purchase Price for Shares

guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>For purposes of this Article V, each person who controls the Investor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
