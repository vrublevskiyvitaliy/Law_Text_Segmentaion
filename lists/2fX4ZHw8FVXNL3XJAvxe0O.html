Interest</li><ul><li>(i) Bank of Ireland Rates:</li>The rate(s) set out in this Offer Letter, whether fixed or variable will be determined by the Bank by reference to the Borrowers category, term, purpose and security proposed for the facility.<br>Fixed rates are rates fixed for a period in excess of one year, determined on the date of original drawdown.<br><br>- Variable<br>On a rate change occurring in the Bank of Ireland Variable Rates, (whether Prime or otherwise), the new rate will automatically apply to the facility as and from the date of such change and the Bank will give details thereof to the Borrower in the statement which issues following such rate changes.<br><br>- Fixed<br>Any fixed rate quoted is the prevailing fixed rate as of the date of offer.<br>Due to possible fluctuations in interest rates, the Bank cannot guarantee that the said fixed rate will apply on drawdown.<br>This being the case, the Borrower can decide to accept the fixed rate applying on the date of drawdown or take a variable rate.<br>At the end of a fixed rate period, the Borrower may request the Bank to provide a further fixed rate period, based on the then existing fixed rate or may revert to the normal variable rate.<br><br>However, the provision of any further fixed rate period from time to time, or any conversion referred to in Clause 6 (2)(b) hereof, will be at the sole discretion of the Bank.<br>If no further fixed rate period is granted at the end of any particular fixed rate term, the facility will revert to a variable rate.<br>Either way, the new rate applying will be notified to the customer.<br><br>On occasion, the Bank, on request, will quote fixed rates which are tied to the money markets.<br>These should be viewed as Market Related Loans for the purpose of liquidity costs, margins, drawdown and rollover procedures.<br>The Cost of Funds will be agreed with the customer on an individual basis prior to drawdown.<br><br><li>(ii) Market Related Rates</li>These are Market Related Rates and are fixed for periods not exceeding 12 months.<br>The Market Related Rate(s) set out in this Offer Letter will be determined by the Bank, with reference to three components:<br>(la) Cost of Funds<br>The rate determined by the Bank on the date of drawdown and calculated by reference to the rate at which the Bank can borrow money on the Euro Interbank Market, for a period corresponding to the relevant interest rate period.<br>The interest rate will be set on the date of drawdown and shall be reset on the first day of each interest rate period.<br><br>OR<br>(1b) EURIBOR<br>The rate determined by the Bank, two Rate Fixing Days prior to drawdown and calculated by reference to the rate at which Euro Jnterbank term deposits, (quoted for spot value on an adjusted 365 day count basis, for a period corresponding to the relevant interest rate period) are being offered within the EMU zone, by one prime bank to another at 11.00 am.<br>(Brussels time).<br><br>Euribor will be quoted to the Bank on a 360 day count basis, adjusted to a 365 day count to take account of existing market practice in Ireland.<br>The amount of interest will vary only to the extent of differences attributable to rounding, when the rate is adjusted from 360 to 365 days.<br><br>Euribor can be availed of on any Rate Fixing Day.<br>Rate Fixing Day means any day on which banks are open for general business in Ireland and Target is operating.<br>Target means the Trans European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System to facilitate, inter alia, large value inter-bank same day payments, which is scheduled to operate every day excluding Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas Day, 26th December, New Years Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday and 1st May.<br>(2) Liquidity Costs /Reserve Asset Cost<br>Such additional percentage rate as the Bank shall determine to be necessary to compensate the Bank, for the cost to the Bank, during the period of the facility, of funding or maintaining a facility in the relevant amount, by reason of the Reserve Asset Requirement relative to such period.<br>Reserve Asset Requirement means any liquidity, reserve ratio, special deposit or similar requirement (or other requirement having the same or similar purpose) of any Regulatory Authority, whether or not having the force of Law with which the Bank has complied.<br><br>(3) Bank Lending Margin<br>The margin is as stated earlier in this Offer Letter.<br>Such margin may be increased at any time, at the discretion of the Bank, if, in the opinion of the Bank, there is an Event of Default or failure to complete and deliver security in the form specified in this Offer Letter or where the Bank has permitted drawdown without satisfaction of Conditions precedent in this Offer Letter.<br>Such increase in margin will be notified to the Borrower in writing and will be effective from the date specified therein.<br><br>Market Related Drawdown/Rollover Procedures<br>Drawdowns and rollovers of facilities may only be accommodated on a Business Day.<br>For a facility which will be determined, inter alia, by reference to Euribor, the Bank must be advised on a Business Day, which is two Rate Fixing Days prior to date of the proposed drawdown.<br>For all other facilities, the Bank may be advised on the day of drawdown.<br><br>All facilities based on Market Related Rates are subject to interest rate period determined on the date of original drawdown or such other period (i.e. 1, 3, 6 or 12 months), as may be agreed between Banker and Borrower.<br><br>On the termination of the original interest rate period and all subsequent interest rate periods determined, unless the Bank is contacted by the Borrower in accordance with these provisions, the Bank will rollover the facility for the same interest rate period, as originally determined, at the prevailing interest rate on the date of rollover, for the relevant interest period.<br><br>In the case of a rate being determined, inter alia, by reference to Euribor, the rate applicable will be set two Rate Fixing Days prior to rollover.<br><br>The Borrower will be notified in writing of the new interest rate and next rollover date.<br><br>Calculation of Interest and Conversions<br>For all facilities set out in this Offer Letter, the Bank will determine the rate of interest.<br>Interest will be calculated and accrued daily on the basis of a 365 day count and be computed and payable by the Borrower on the daily balance outstanding (after adjustment is made for items in the course of collection) on the facility and shall be compoundable at such quarterly or other periodic rests as the Bank, in its absolute discretion, shall determine and in accordance with the Banks practice for accounts, from time to time.<br><br>For all facilities subject to a repayment schedule, any variation in the interest rate (whether arising because of an adjustment of interest rates, as between one fixed rate period and another fixed rate period or otherwise) may be accommodated at the discretion of the Bank by way of:<br><ul><li>(a) an adjustment to the amount of the repayments during the remaining period of the facility:</li>or<br><li>(b) an adjustment of the number of repayments within the remaining period of the facility:</li>or<br><li>(c) an adjustment in the amount of the final repayment.</li><br>If no such adjustment is made, repayments will continue until the facility, together with interest, is repaid notwithstanding that this may alter the period originally envisaged.<br><br>As and when it is considered necessary or desirable, the Bank will make such adjustments, amendments or variations to the terms of this letter as it considers appropriate, due to the impact of the third stage of EMU and any consequent changes in market practices, so as to put the Bank in the same position, as far as possible, as it would have been in if no such event had occurred.<br><br>Change in the Method of Calculation of Interest for all facilities set out in this Offer Letter<br>The method for calculating interest and the interest rate may be changed in respect of all facilities from time to time at the Banks absolute discretion, whether to take account of a change in prevailing market conventions in Ireland or otherwise.<br>In the event of such change occurring during the continuance of this facility, the Bank will give to the Borrower one months prior notice that such change is to take place with effect from the date of expiry of such notice.<br><br></ul></ul><li>6.
