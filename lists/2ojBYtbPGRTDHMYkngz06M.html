Credit Issuers honor of a draw for which the draw or any certificate fails to comply in any respect with the terms of the Letter of Credit.<br>None of the foregoing shall affect, impair, or prevent

hereunder to any such Person.<br><br><li>(iv) Rights Against the Letter of Credit Issuer</li>Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(f)is intended to limit any Borrowers rights, if any, with respect to the Letter of Credit Issuer that arise as a result of the letter of credit application and related documents executed by and between such Borrower and the Letter of Credit Issuer.<br><br><li>(v)

against receipt, at least ten days prior to such action to the Obligated Parties address specified in or pursuant to Section 15.8.<br>If any Collateral is sold on terms other than payment in full at the time of sale, no credit shall be given against the Obligations until the Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or the Lenders receive payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Collateral

process, appropriate, and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and may forthwith sell, lease, license, assign, give an option or options to purchase, or sell or otherwise dispose of and

Obligated Party.<br>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Obligated Party waives all claims, damages, and demands against the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider arising out of the repossession, retention, or sale of the Collateral except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Provider as determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.<br>Each Obligated Party agrees that ten days prior notice by the Collateral Agent of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters.<br>Each Obligated Party shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations, including any attorneys fees or other expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider to collect such deficiency.<br><br><li>(f) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the other Loan Documents, each Obligated Party hereby waives presentment, demand, protest, or any notice (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Agreement or any Collateral</li><br><li>(g) To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Collateral Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Obligated Party acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Collateral Agent (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Collateral Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work-in-process into finished goods or other finished products for

investment bankers, consultants, and other professionals to</li>130<br>assist the Collateral Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral.<br>Each Obligated Party acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 11.2(g)is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in the Collateral Agents exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.2(g).<br>Without limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 11.2(g)shall be construed to grant any rights to any Obligated Party or to impose any duties on the Collateral

this Agreement.<br>If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Administrative Agent will notify the Borrowers of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for its account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the

of any Lender to make any Loan on any Funding Date (any such Lender, prior to the cure of such failure, being referred to herein as a Defaulting Lender) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Loan on such Funding Date.<br>No Lender shall be responsible for any other Lenders failure to advance such other Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing.<br><br><li>(d)

Borrowers request, each Agent (acting in its individual capacity as a Lender) or an Eligible Assignee reasonably acceptable to the Agents and the Borrowers shall have the right (but not the

judgment.<br><br></ul><li>(c) Recovery or Avoidance of Payments; Refund of Payments in Error</li>In the event any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower received by the Administrative Agent with

full to it on such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Revolving Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Revolving Lender.<br>If and to the extent the Borrowers have not made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Revolving Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Revolving Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Revolving Lender until the date repaid.<br><br><li>(d) Indemnification by the Lenders</li>To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, the Revolving Lenders agree to indemnify the Letter of Credit Issuer ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Letter of Credit Issuer in any way relating to or arising out of any Letter of Credit or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document in connection therewith; provided that no Revolving Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Letter of Credit Issuers own gross negligence or willful misconduct.<br>Without limiting the foregoing, each Revolving Lender agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or expenses payable by any Borrower to the Letter of Credit Issuer to the extent that the Letter of Credit Issuer is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by a Borrower.<br>The agreement contained in this Section shall survive payment in full of all other

other Obligated Party makes any transfer (including any payment, grant, guaranty, or granting of a Lien) pursuant to this Agreement (any such payment or transfer being referred to herein as an Accommodation Payment), then the Obligated Party making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Obligated Parties

denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Obligated Parties.<br>As of any date of determination, the Allocable Amount of each Obligated Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments that could be asserted against such Obligated Party hereunder without (a) rendering such Obligated Party insolvent within the meaning of Section 101 (32) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA), (b) leaving such Obligated Party with unreasonably small

due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.<br>All rights and claims of contribution, indemnification, and reimbursement under this Section shall be subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations.<br>The provisions of this Section shall, to the extent expressly inconsistent with any provision in any Loan Document, supersede such inconsistent provision.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall limit the liability or obligation of any Person (the subject Person)
