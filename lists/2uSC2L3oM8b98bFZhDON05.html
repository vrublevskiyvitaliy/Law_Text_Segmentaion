whole or in part, shares of Common Stock of the Company, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 5, by delivery of an original or electronic copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as Exhibit A

Stockholder Approval Date.<br><br></ul><li>2.Procedure for Exercise</li><br><ul><li>2.1Delivery of Stock Certificates, etc</li>on Exercise.<br>The Company agrees that the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to be issued to the Holder as the record owner of such shares as of the close of business on the date on which both the Exercise Notice and payment have been made for such shares.<br>As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant in full or in part, and in any event within 3 business days thereafter, the Company at its expense (including the payment by it of any applicable issue taxes) will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder, or as such Holder (upon payment by such holder of any applicable

anniversary of the Issue Date and if the resale of the Warrant Shares have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock is greater than the Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the Holder may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being cancelled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with the Exercise Notice, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of shares of Common Stock computed using the following formula:<br>X=Y (A-B)<br>A<br>Where X= the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Holder<br>Y=<br>the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Warrant or, if only a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the Warrant being exercised (at the date of such calculation)<br>A=<br>the Fair Market Value of one share of the Companys Common Stock (at the date of such calculation)<br>B=<br>Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)<br><li>4.Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation, Merger, etc</li><br><ul><li>4.1.</li>In case at any time or from time to time, the Company shall (a) effect a reorganization, (b) consolidate with or merge into any other person or entity, or (c) transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any other person or entity under any plan or arrangement contemplating the dissolution of the Company, then, in each such case, as a condition to the consummation of such a transaction, proper and adequate provision shall be made by the Company whereby the Holder of this Warrant, on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1 at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the effective date of such dissolution, as the case may be, shall receive, in lieu of the Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on such exercise prior to such consummation or such effective date, the stock and other securities and property (including<br>cash) to which such Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation or in connection with such dissolution, as the case may be, if such Holder had so exercised this Warrant, immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment thereafter as provided in Section 5.<br><br><li>4.2.</li>In the event of any dissolution of the Company following the transfer of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, the Company, prior to such dissolution, shall at its expense deliver or cause to be delivered the stock and other securities and property (including cash, where applicable) receivable by the Holder of the Warrant after the effective date of such dissolution pursuant to Section 4.1 to a bank or trust company having its principal office in New York, NY, as trustee for the Holder of the Warrant.<br><br><li>4.3.</li>Upon any reorganization, consolidation, merger or transfer (and any dissolution following any transfer) referred to in this Section 4, this Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the terms hereof shall be applicable to the shares of stock and other securities and property receivable on the exercise of this Warrant after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger or the effective date of dissolution following any such transfer, as the case may be, and shall be binding upon the issuer of any such stock or other securities, including, in the case of any such transfer, the person acquiring all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company, whether or not such person shall have expressly assumed the terms of this Warrant as provided in Section 4.1.<br>In the event this Warrant does not continue in full force and effect after the consummation of the transactions described in this Section 4, then only in such event will the Company's securities and property (including cash, where applicable) receivable by the holders of the Warrant be delivered to the Trustee as contemplated by Section 4.2.<br><br></ul><li>5.Adjustments for Stock Splits, Combinations, etc.</li>The Exercise Price, as so adjusted, shall be readjusted in the same manner upon the happening of any successive event or events described herein in this Section 5.<br>The number of shares of Common Stock that the holder of this Warrant shall thereafter, on the exercise hereof as provided in Section 1, be entitled to receive shall be adjusted to a number determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Section 5) be issuable on such exercise by a fraction of which (a) the numerator is the Exercise Price that would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Section 5) be in effect, and (b) the denominator is the Exercise Price in effect on the date of such exercise.<br><br><li>6.Certificate as to Adjustments</li>In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) issuable on the exercise of the Warrant, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of the Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based,

sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock (or Other Securities) outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant.<br>The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the holder of the Warrant and any Warrant agent of the Company (appointed pursuant to Section 12 hereof).<br><br><li>7.Reservation of Stock Issuable on Exercise of Warrant</li>The

deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.<br><br><li>10.Maximum Exercise</li>The Holder shall not be entitled to exercise this Warrant on an exercise date, in connection with that number of shares of Common Stock which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates on an exercise date, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made on an exercise date, which would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company on such date.<br>For the purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder.<br>Subject to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited to aggregate exercises which would result in the issuance of more than 4.99%.<br><br><li>11.Warrant Agent</li>The Company may, by written notice to each holder of the Warrant, appoint an agent for the purpose of issuing Common Stock (or Other Securities) on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 1, exchanging this Warrant pursuant to Section 8, and replacing this Warrant pursuant to Section 9, or any of the foregoing, and thereafter any such issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such agent.<br><br><li>12.Transfer on the Company's Books</li>Until this Warrant is transferred on the books of the Company, the Company may treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.<br><br><li>13.Voluntary Adjustment by the Company</li>The Company may at any time during the term of this Warrant reduce the then current

provision of this Warrant is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law.<br>Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Warrant.<br>The headings in this Warrant are for purposes of reference only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the terms hereof.<br>The invalidity or
