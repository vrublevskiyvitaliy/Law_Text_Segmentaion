considers reasonably necessary to assure the Company that the issuance of its securities upon exercise of this Warrant shall not violate any federal or state securities laws.<br>The Company shall not

Section 6(b) shall be null and void ab initio.<br><br><li>(c) Subject to the terms of this Section 6, upon surrender of this Warrant to the Company at its principal office or at the office of its transfer agent, if any, with the Assignment Form annexed hereto as Exhibit B duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any</li>6<br>transfer tax, the Company shall, without charge, execute and deliver a new Warrant in the name of the assignee evidencing the portion of the Warrant certificate so transferred and a new Warrant certificate evidencing the remaining portion of the Warrant certificate not

time to time as follows:<br><ul><li>(a) Stock Splits</li>If the Company subdivides (by any stock split, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of Warrant Shares will be proportionately increased.<br>If the Company combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the combination will be proportionately increased and the number of Warrant Shares will be proportionately decreased.<br>Any adjustment under this Section 7(a) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.<br><br><li>(b) Stock Dividends</li>If the Company declares a dividend or any other distribution upon the Common Stock (other than the Rights Offering) that is payable in shares of Common Stock or Derivative Securities, the number of Warrant Shares will be proportionately increased and the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the declaration of the dividend or distribution will be reduced to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the declaration multiplied by the then effective Exercise Price by (ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the declaration (assuming the exercise or conversion of any such Derivative Securities for cash (not on a cashless basis)).<br><br><li>(c) Adjustment for Property Dividends</li>If the Company declares a dividend or any other distribution upon the Common Stock that is payable in any of its assets (including cash) or debt securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase debt securities, assets or other securities of the Company (other than (i) Common Stock pursuant to which another provision of this Section 7 applies or (ii) any dividend or distribution upon a merger or consolidation or sale to which Section 8 applies) (a Property Dividend), then and in each such event the Exercise Price for this Warrant in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution shall be decreased by the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution filed with the Company) of such Property Dividend so distributed for each share of Common Stock.<br><br>7<br>Any adjustment under this Section 7(c) shall, become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive Property Dividend.<br>If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any Property Dividend for purposes of this Section 7(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities comprising such Property Dividend, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Fair Market Value (pursuant to Section 7(e)) per share of Common Stock.<br><br>For purposes of clarity, if a declared Property Dividend would have reduced the Exercise Price to an amount below $0, the Exercise Price will be reduced to $0 and any remaining fair market value of the Property Dividend that would have resulted in a reduction of the Exercise Price below $0 shall be reflected in an increase of the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant pursuant to Section 7(d) hereto.<br><br><li>(d) Adjustment for Property Dividend In Special Circumstances</li>In the event that the Exercise Price is or has been reduced to $0 or a price that rounds to $0 due to adjustments to the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 7(c) and the Company declares a dividend or any other distribution upon the Common Stock that is a Property Dividend, this Section 7(d) shall apply and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:<br>N = N x M<br>M - F<br>where:<br>N<br>=<br>the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.<br><br>N<br>=<br>the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant.<br><br>M<br>=<br>the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the ex date for such distribution.<br><br>F<br>=<br>the fair market value on the ex date for such distribution of the assets, securities, rights or warrants distributable to one share of Common Stock after taking into account, in the case of any rights, options or warrants, the consideration required to be paid upon exercise thereof.<br>The Board of Directors of the Company shall reasonably determine the fair market value in good faith.<br><br>The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.<br><br>This Section 7(d) does not apply to regular quarterly cash dividends.<br>If any adjustment is made pursuant to this Section 7(d) as a result of the issuance of rights, options or warrants and at the end of the period during which any such rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all such rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, this Warrant shall be immediately readjusted as if F in the above formula was the fair market value on the ex date<br>8<br>for such distribution of the indebtedness or assets actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the ex-dividend date for such distribution.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7(d), if M-F in the above formula is less than $1.00, the Company may elect to, and if M-F or is a negative number, the Company shall, in lieu of the adjustment otherwise required by this Section 7(d), distribute to the holder of this Warrant, upon exercise thereof, the evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights, options or warrants (or the proceeds thereof) which would have been distributed to such holder had this Warrant been exercised (for cash) immediately prior to the record date for such distribution.<br><br>Closing Price on any date of determination means (i) the closing sale price for the regular trading session (without considering after hours or other trading outside regular trading session hours) of the Common Stock (regular way) as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, (ii)

organization, or (iii) if the Common Stock is not so quoted, the average of the mid-point of the last bid and ask prices for the Common Stock from at least three nationally recognized investment banking firms that the Company selects for this purpose.<br><br>ex date means the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the Quoted Price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution.<br><br>Trading Day means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, other than any day on which securities are not traded on the applicable securities exchange or in the applicable securities market.<br><br><li>(e) Issuance of Common Stock Below Current Fair Market Value</li>If the Company shall issue or sell shares of Common Stock, or Derivative Securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to someone other than the Holder, at a price per share (determined, in the case of such Derivative Securities, by dividing (A) the total amount receivable by the Company in consideration of the issuance and sale of such Derivative Securities, plus the total consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Derivative Securities) that is lower than the then current Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock in effect immediately prior to such sale or issuance, then (1) the number of Warrant Shares thereafter issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased by adding the number of Warrant Shares theretofore issuable upon exercise of this Warrant to the product of (x) the Cheap Stock Issued (defined below), multiplied by (y) the Ownership Ratio (defined below); and (2) the Exercise Price shall be reduced by multiplying the then current Exercise Price by a fraction of which, the numerator shall be the number of Warrant Shares issuable immediately prior to such sale or issuance and the denominator of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares issuable after adjustment pursuant to clause (1), above.<br>Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such sale or issuance is made.<br><br>9<br>Cheap Stock Issued shall be the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued or offered by the Company for subscription or purchase as described above minus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered would purchase at the then current Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock.<br><br>Ownership Ratio shall be a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Warrant Shares prior to such time issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding on the date of issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock or such Derivative Securities.<br>For purposes of such adjustments, the shares of Common Stock which the holder of any such Derivative Securities shall be entitled to subscribe for or purchase (assuming the exercise or conversion of any such Derivative Securities for cash (not on a cashless basis)) shall be deemed to be issued and outstanding as of the date of the sale and issuance of the rights, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities.<br><br>Fair Market Value shall be equal to a discount of 10% to the average VWAP of the Common Stock for the thirty days preceding the issuance of such shares of Common Stock, or Derivative Securities.<br><br>VWAP means, for any date, the price determined by the first of the following clauses that applies: (a) if the Common Stock is then listed or quoted on a Trading Market, the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for such date (or the nearest preceding date) on the Trading Market on which the Common Stock

of reporting prices), the most recent bid price per share of the Common Stock so reported; or (d) in all other cases, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by an independent appraiser selected in good faith by the Holder and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Company.<br><br>Trading Market means the following markets or exchanges on which the Common Stock is listed or quoted for trading on the date in question: the American Stock Exchange, The Nasdaq Capital Market, The Nasdaq Global Market, The Nasdaq Global Select Market, the New York Stock Exchange or the OTC Bulletin Board.<br><br><li>(f) Other Adjustments</li><br><ul><li>(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, if, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company shall issue or sell shares of Common Stock, or Derivative Securities to someone other than the Holder, at a price per share (determined, in the case of such Derivative Securities, by dividing (A) the total amount</li>10<br>receivable by the Company in consideration of the issuance and sale of such Derivative Securities, plus the total consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, by (B) the total number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Derivative Securities) that is lower than the Exercise Price, the Company shall adjust the Exercise Price and number of shares into which this Warrant is convertible so that this Warrant shall be exercisable for the same percentage of the outstanding Common Stock (on an as converted basis) following the issuance or sale of such other shares of Common Stock or Derivative Securities for the same aggregate consideration prior to such adjustment; provided, that such adjustments shall only be made for the benefit of the Holder of this Warrant.<br><br><li>(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7, if, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, the number of shares underlying any Derivative Security, and/or the exercise or conversion price of such Derivative Security adjusts or would have adjusted for any reason (including as a result of the issuance of this Warrant) and the terms, manner or method of such adjustment are more favorable than the adjustment provisions contained in this Section 7, the Company shall adjust the Exercise Price and/or number of shares into which this Warrant is convertible in order to give the Holder the benefit of the more favorable terms, manner and/or method; provided, that no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 7(f)(ii): (A) if an adjustment is otherwise required pursuant to another provision contained in this Section 7; (B) if the additional adjustment that may be required by this Section 7(f)(ii) would not require a decrease or increase of at least 1% in the Exercise Price then in effect or the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is then exercisable; or (C) solely as a result of an adjustment pursuant to Section 7(f) of those certain warrants to purchase Common Stock each dated December 31, 2008 and issued to purchasers of shares of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company in connection with the purchase of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock</li>For the avoidance of doubt, the Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable shall be adjusted so that this Warrant shall be exercisable for the same percentage of the outstanding Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis) following the adjustment of such other Derivative Security pursuant to the foregoing sentence for the same aggregate consideration prior to such adjustment; provided, that following such adjustment, if the exercise price of such other Derivate Security is less than the Exercise Price, the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the same exercise price as the Derivative Security; provided further, that such adjustments shall only be made for the benefit of the Holder of this Warrant.<br><br></ul><li>(g) Section 7(e) and Section 7(f)(i) shall not apply to: (i) securities issued to employees, officers,

acquiring Person or (ii) other Change of Control following which the Company is not a surviving entity, the Company will secure from the Person purchasing the assets or the successor resulting from
