or</li>2<br><li>(b) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares of Common Stock, or</li><li>(c) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock,</li>then the per share Exercise Price shall be adjusted, for the purpose of preserving the economic value of this Warrant, to the price determined by multiplying the per share Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or combination or the taking of a record of holders in respect of such payment or distribution, as the case may be (each, a Triggering Event) by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company immediately prior to such Triggering Event, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company immediately after such Triggering Event.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 4.2.</li>Upon each adjustment of the per share Exercise Price, the number of shares of Common Stock subsequently purchasable hereunder shall be an amount equal to the quotient derived by dividing the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately before such adjustment by the per share Exercise Price in effect immediately following such adjustment or readjustment.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 4.3.</li>Whenever the per share Exercise Price or number of shares deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4, the Company shall promptly prepare a certificate signed by the President or a Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Company setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which

reclassification of the Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company, then, as a condition of such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the Holder shall thereafter have the right to receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore purchasable hereunder, such shares of stock, securities or assets (including, without limitation, cash), if any, as may (by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification) be issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore so purchasable hereunder had such consolidation, merger, sale, reorganization or reclassification not taken place, and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder to the end that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant.<br>The Company shall not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale unless (a) the Company provides the holder hereof with not less than 10 days prior written notice of such consolidation, merger or sale (provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such corporate event), and (b) prior to the consummation thereof, the successor entity (if other than the Company) resulting from consolidation or merger or the entity purchasing such assets assumes, by written instrument, the obligation to deliver to each such holder such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire.<br><br><li>SECTION 6.DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION</li><br>If the Company declares or pays a dividend upon the Common Stock payable otherwise than in cash out of earnings or earned surplus (determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied) except for a stock dividend payable in shares of Common Stock (a Liquidating Dividend), then the Company shall pay to the Holder at the time of payment thereof the Liquidating Dividend which would have been paid to such holder on the Common Stock had this Warrant been fully exercised immediately prior to the date on which a record is taken for such Liquidating Dividend, or, if no record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock entitled to such dividends are to be determined.<br><br>3<br><li>SECTION 7.NOTICE OF DIVIDENDS</li>; PAYMENTS<br>If the Board of Directors of the Company shall declare any dividend or other distribution on any class of its Common Stock except by way of a stock dividend payable in Common Stock on its Common Stock, the Company shall mail notice thereof to the Holder not less than 10 days prior to the record date fixed for determining shareholders entitled to participate in such dividend or other distribution, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, as a consent fee, cash or other property from the Company in an amount and of the same type (cash or property) equal to that which the holder would have been entitled to receive if the unexercised portion hereof had been exercised as of the record date of such dividend or distribution.<br><br><li>SECTION 8.NO FRACTIONAL SHARES</li><br>No fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant under any circumstances.<br><br><li>SECTION 9.FULLY PAID STOCK</li><br>The Company covenants and agrees to take all such actions necessary to ensure that the shares of stock represented by each and every certificate for its Common Stock to be delivered on the exercise of the purchase rights herein provided for shall, at the time of such delivery, be validly issued and outstanding and be fully paid and nonassessable.<br>In addition, the Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of any trading market or securities exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may be listed.<br><br><li>SECTION 10.CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS</li><br>The right to exercise this Warrant shall not be suspended during any period that the stock transfer books of the Company for its Common Stock may be closed.<br>The Company shall not be required, however, to deliver certificates of its Common Stock upon such exercise while such books are duly closed for any purpose, but the Company may postpone the delivery of the certificates for the Common Stock until the opening of such books, and they shall, in such case, be delivered forthwith upon the opening thereof, or as soon as practicable thereafter.<br><br><li>SECTION 11.RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERABILITY OF WARRANTS AND SHARES</li>; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS<br>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Warrant to the contrary, the terms and

with the provisions of such legend, including the legend set forth on the first page hereof.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 11.3.</li>The initial Holder of this Warrant represents that he is an a
