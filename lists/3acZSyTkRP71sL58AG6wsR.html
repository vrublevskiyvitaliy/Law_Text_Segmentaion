Exhibit 10.2<br>SunTrust Banks, Inc.<br><br>2009 Stock Plan<br>Salary Share Stock Unit Agreement<br>SunTrust Banks, Inc.<br>(SunTrust), a Georgia corporation, pursuant to action of the Compensation Committee (Committee) and in accordance with the SunTrust Banks, Inc.<br>2009 Stock Plan (Plan), has determined that going forward and until the Committee determines otherwise Grantees base salary will be payable partly in cash and partly in stock units.<br>The Committee therefore has granted these stock units (the Stock Units) to Grantee as a periodic payment of the stock portion of Grantees salary, net of applicable withholdings and other deductions.<br><br>Name of Grantee<br>[Name]<br>Number of<br>Stock Units<br>[# of Units]<br>Grant Date<br>[Grant Date]<br>Each Stock Unit represents the right to receive a payment in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of SunTrust Common Stock, $1.00 par value, at a future date and time, subject to the terms of this Salary Share Stock Unit Agreement.<br>The number of Stock Units was calculated as follows.<br>First, the salary amount to be paid in Stock Units was divided by the reported closing price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for a share of SunTrust common stock on the pay date for the relevant pay period (or, if not a NYSE trading day, on the immediately preceding such trading day) to determine the gross number of Stock Units to be awarded to Grantee.<br>Next, the dollar amount of applicable tax withholdings and other deductions was determined, and was divided by the reported closing price on the NYSE for a share of SunTrust common stock on the pay date for the relevant pay period (or, if not a NYSE trading day, on the immediately preceding such trading day) to determine the number of Stock Units to be retained and cancelled by the Company in lieu of such taxes and other deductions.<br>Finally, an account was credited on behalf of Grantee for the net amount of Stock Units described in the preceding two sentences.<br>This Salary Share Stock Unit Agreement (the Salary Agreement) evidences this grant, which has been made subject to all the terms and conditions set forth on the attached Terms and Conditions and in the Plan.<br><br>SUNTRUST BANKS, INC.<br><br>Authorized Officer<br>1<br><ul><li>EFFECTIVE DATE</li>This grant of Stock Units to the Grantee is effective as of  (Grant

time to time.<br><br><li>VESTING</li>Once awarded, the Stock Units will be fully vested and not subject to the risk of forfeiture or any requirement of future service.<br><br><li>GRANTEES RIGHTS PRIOR TO PAYMENT</li><br><ul><li>(a) The Stock Unit award will not include any rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents</li><br><li>(b) Nothing in the Plan, this Agreement, or the Stock Units

Units, March 31, 2012, and (c) the date of Grantees death.<br>The amount to be paid on settlement of the Stock Units will be equal to the number of Stock Units being settled multiplied by the reported closing price on the NYSE for a share of SunTrust common stock on the settlement date (or, if not a NYSE trading day, on the immediately preceding such trading day).<br><br>The value of the Stock Units shall be paid in a cash lump sum on the Settlement Date.<br>For purposes of this  4, the value of each Stock Unit will equal the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Settlement

requirements, including federal, state, and local requirements.<br>The Grantee must pay to SunTrust any applicable federal, state or local withholding tax due as a result of such payment.<br>Where Grantee has not previously satisfied all applicable withholding tax obligations, SunTrust will, at the time the tax withholding obligation arises in connection herewith, retain an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum amount of taxes then required to be withheld by the Company in connection therewith from any amounts then payable hereunder to Grantee.<br>If any withholding is required prior to the time amounts are payable to Grantee hereunder, the withholding will be taken from other compensation then payable to Grantee or as otherwise determined by SunTrust.<br><br><li>NO EMPLOYMENT
