necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such holder and each such Electing Holder for any and all legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors shall be liable to any such person in

Section 6(d).<br>The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to

such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.<br>No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>The holders obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the principal amount of Registrable Securities registered by them and not joint.<br><br><li>(e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability
