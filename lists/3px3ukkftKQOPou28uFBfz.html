the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provisions of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived in accordance with Section 6.04 of this Indenture.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of each Holder affected, a supplemental indenture or waiver shall not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):<br>(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;<br>-30-<br>(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note;<br>(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;<br>(4) waive a Default in the

indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.<br><br>After a supplemental indenture under this Section becomes effective, the Issuer shall mail to Noteholders a notice briefly describing such supplemental indenture.<br>The failure to give such notice to all Noteholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of a supplemental indenture under this Section.<br><br>No amendment may be made to Article X of this Indenture that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt of the Issuer then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or any group or Representative thereof authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act</li>Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, every supplemental indenture to this Indenture or the Notes shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers</li>A consent to a supplemental indenture or a waiver by a Holder shall bind such Holder and every subsequent Holder of such Note or portion of the Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Note.<br>However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holders Note or portion of the Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective.<br>After a supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Noteholder.<br>Except if otherwise specified in such supplemental indenture or waiver, a supplemental indenture or waiver becomes effective once the requisite number of consents are received by the Issuer or the Trustee.<br>The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture.<br>If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.04, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly<br>-31-<br>designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes</li>If a supplemental indenture changes the terms of a Note, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Note to deliver such Note to the Trustee.<br>The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Note regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder.<br>Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determines, the Issuer in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms.<br>Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Note shall not affect the validity of such supplemental indenture.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 9.06 Trustee To Sign Supplemental Indentures</li>The Trustee shall sign any supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article IX if such supplemental indenture does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.<br>If it does, the Trustee may but need not sign it.<br>In signing such supplemental indenture the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, that such supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions hereof (including Section 9.03).<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 9.07 Payment for Consent</li>Neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of the Issuer shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder for

Subordination</li>The Issuer agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Obligations with respect to the Notes (including principal of, interest on and all other amounts with respect to the Notes) are subordinated and junior in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article X, to the prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed); that the subordination is for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Senior Debt, and that each holder of Senior Debt whether now outstanding or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed shall be deemed to have acquired Senior Debt in reliance upon the covenants and provisions contained in this Indenture and the Notes.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.02 No Payment on Notes in Certain Circumstances</li>If any default occurs and is continuing in the payment when due, whether at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise, of any principal of, interest on, unpaid drawings for letters<br>-32-<br>of credit issued in respect of, or regularly accruing fees with respect to, any Designated Senior Debt, no payment of any kind or character shall be made by, or on behalf of, the Issuer or any other Person on its or their behalf with respect to any Obligations on the Notes, or to acquire any of the Notes for cash or property or otherwise.<br>In addition, if any other event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to any Designated Senior Debt, as such event of default is defined in the instrument creating or evidencing such Designated Senior Debt, permitting the holders of such Designated Senior Debt then outstanding to accelerate the maturity thereof and if the Representative for the respective issue of Designated Senior Debt gives written notice of such event of default to the Trustee (a Default Notice), then, unless and until all such events of default have been cured or waived or have ceased to exist or the Trustee receives notice thereof from the Representative for the respective issue of Designated Senior Debt terminating the Blockage Period (as defined below), during the 179 days after the delivery of such Default Notice (the Blockage Period), neither the Issuer nor any other Person on its behalf shall (x) make any payment of any kind or character with respect to any Obligations on the Notes (other than payment of amounts already deposited in accordance with the satisfaction and discharge provisions of this Indenture) or (y) acquire any of the Notes for cash or property or otherwise.<br>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will a Blockage Period extend beyond 180 days from the date the payment on the Notes was due and only one such Blockage Period may be commenced within any 360 consecutive days.<br>No event of default which existed or was continuing on the date of the commencement of any Blockage Period with respect to the Designated Senior Debt shall be, or be made, the basis for the commencement of a second Blockage Period by the Representative of such Designated Senior Debt whether or not within a period of 360 consecutive days, unless such event of default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 90 consecutive days (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action or any breach of any financial covenants for a period commencing after the date of commencement of such Blockage Period that, in either case, would give rise to an event of default pursuant to any provisions under which an event of default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new event of default for this purpose).<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.03 Distributions in Liquidation or Bankruptcy</li>Upon any distribution to creditors of the Issuer in a liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Issuer or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Issuers assets and liabilities:<br><ul><li>(a) holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt) before Holders will be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Notes; and</li><li>(b) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in the preceding clause (a) above) are paid in full in cash, any distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article X will be made to holders of Senior Debt, as their interests may appear</li><br></ul></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.04 Notice of Event of Default and Acceleration</li>The Issuer shall deliver to the holders of Senior Debt or their Representative, as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days after the Issuer becomes aware of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, notice of such Default or Event of Default.<br><br>-33-<br>If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Issuer will promptly notify holders of Senior Debt or their Representative of such acceleration.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.05 When Distribution Must be Paid Over</li>In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by this Article X, such payment will be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and will be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to, the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the agreement, indenture or other document (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.06 Duties of Trustee</li>With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only those obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article X, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt will be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.<br>The Trustee will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and will not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee pays over or distributes to or on behalf of Holders or the Issuer or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt are then entitled by virtue of this Article X, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.07 Notice of Violations</li>The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Issuer that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article X, but failure to give such notice will not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article X.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.08 Subrogation</li>After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders will be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Debt pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt.<br>A distribution made under this Article X to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on the Notes.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.09 No Impairment</li>This Article X defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Debt.<br>Nothing in this Indenture will:<br></ul><ul><li>(a) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders, the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms;</li>-34-<br><li>(b) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Issuer other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or</li><li>(c) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders.</li><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.10 Right of Senior Debt to Enforce</li>No right of any holder of Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Debt evidenced by the Notes may be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Issuer or any Holder or by the failure of the Issuer or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.11 Notice to Senior Debt</li>Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to such holders or their Representative.<br><br>Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer referred to in this Article X, the Trustee and the Holders will be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Debt of the Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article X.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.12 Knowledge of Trustee</li>The provisions of this Article X or any other provision of this Indenture notwithstanding, the Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at least five Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article X. Only the Issuer or a Representative may give the notice.<br>Nothing in this Article X will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.13 Authorization to Effect Subordination; Power of Attorney</li>Each Holder of Notes, by the Holders acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holders behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article X, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holders attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.<br>If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.09 of this Indenture at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim on behalf of the Holders.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.14 Modification</li>The provisions of this Article X may only be amended or modified in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02 of this Indenture.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 10.15 This Article X Not to Prevent Events of Default</li>The provisions of this Article X shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default due to the failure to make a payment on account of principal of or interest on the Notes by reason of any provision of this Article X.<br><br>-35-<br>ARTICLE XI<br>MISCELLANEOUS<br><li>SECTION 11.01 Trust Indenture Act Controls</li>If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control.<br><br></ul><ul><li>SECTION 11.02 Notices</li>Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and delivered in person, via facsimile or mailed by first-class mail addressed as follows:<br>if to the Issuer:<br>Jupiter Saturn Holding Company<br>(to be renamed Towers Watson & Co. at the Effective Time)<br>c/o Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Inc.<br><br>901 N.<br>Glebe Road<br>Arlington, VA 22203<br>Attention: Walter W.
