understands that:<br><ul><li>(i)Both the Option and any Shares purchased upon its exercise are securities, the issuance by the Company of which requires compliance with federal and state securities laws;</li><br><li>(ii)These securities are made available to Optionee only on the condition that Optionee makes the representations contained in this Section 4 to the Company;</li><br><li>(iii)Optionee has made a reasonable investigation of the affairs of the Company sufficient to be well informed as to the rights and the value of these securities;</li><br><li>(iv)Optionee understands that the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") in reliance upon one or more specific exemptions contained in the Act, which may include reliance on Rule 701 promulgated under the Act, if available, or which may depend upon: (a) Optionee's bona fide investment intention in acquiring these securities; (b) Optionee's intention to hold these securities in compliance with federal and state securities laws; (c) Optionee having no present intention of selling or transferring any part thereof (recognizing that the Option is not transferable) in violation of applicable federal and state securities laws; and (d) there being certain restrictions on transfer of the Shares subject to the

Act, or unless an exemption from registration is available; that Rule 144, the usual exemption from registration, is only available after the satisfaction of certain holding periods and in the presence of a public market for the Shares; that there is no certainty that a public market for the Shares will exist, and that otherwise it will be necessary that the Shares be sold pursuant to another exemption from registration which may be difficult to satisfy; and,</li><br><li>(vi)Optionee understands that the certificate representing the Shares will bear a legend prohibiting their transfer in the absence of their registration or the opinion of counsel for the Company that registration is not required, and a legend prohibiting their transfer in compliance with applicable state securities laws unless otherwise exempted.</li><br><br></ul><li>5.Method of Payment</li>Payment of the purchase price may be made subject to the terms of Section 14 herein, or by cash, check or, in

the Shares being purchased.<br><br><li>6.Restrictions on Exercise</li>The Option may not be exercised if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such Shares would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state securities or other law or regulation.<br>As a condition to the exercise of the Option, the Company may require Optionee to make any representation and warranty to the Company as may be required by any applicable law or regulation.<br><br><li>7.Termination of Status as an Employee or Consultant</li>In the event of termination of Optionee's continuous status as an Employee or Consultant, as such status may be determined and construed by the Company in its sole discretion (Continuous Status), for any reason other than death or disability or the completed term and performance under any consulting or employment agreement between the Optionee and the Company, Optionee may, but only within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in Section 11 below), exercise the Option to the extent that Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination.<br>To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or if Optionee does not exercise the Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.<br><br><li>8.Disability of Optionee</li>In the event of termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant as

of the term of the Option as set forth in Section 11 below), exercise the Option to the extent Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination; provided, however that if the disability is not total and permanent (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) and the Optionee exercises the option within the period provided above but more than three months after the date of termination, the Option shall automatically be deemed to be a Nonstatutory Stock Option and not an Incentive Stock Option; and provided, further, that if the disability is total and permanent (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), then the Optionee may, but only within one (1) year from the date of termination of employment or consulting relationship (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in Section 11 below), exercise the Option to the extent Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination.<br>To the extent that Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of termination, or if Optionee does not exercise such Option (which Optionee was entitled to exercise) within the time periods specified herein, the Option shall terminate.<br><br><li>9.Death of Optionee</li>In the event of the death of Optionee:<br><ul><li>(i)During the term of the Option while an Employee or Consultant of the Company and having been in Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant since the date of grant of the Option, the Option may be exercised, at any time within one (1) year following the date of death (but, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in Section 11 below), by Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the time of death of the Optionee.</li><br>To the extent that such Employee or Consultant was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death, or if such Employee, Consultant, estate or other person does not exercise such Option (which such Employee, Consultant, estate or person was entitled to exercise) within the one (1) year time period specified herein, the Option shall terminate; or,<br><li>(ii)During the thirty (30) day period specified in Section 7 or the one (1) year period specified in Section 8, after the termination of Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant, the Option may be exercised, at any time within one (1) year following the date of death (but, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in Section 11 below), by Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.</li><br>To the extent that such Employee or Consultant was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death, or if such Employee, Consultant, estate or other person does not exercise such Option (which such Employee, Consultant, estate or person was entitled to exercise) within the one (1) year time period specified herein, the Option shall terminate.<br><br></ul><li>10.Non-Transferability of Option</li>The Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee, only by Optionee.<br>The terms of the Option shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of Optionee.<br><br><li>11.Term of Option</li>The Option may not be exercised more than five (5) years from the date of grant of the Option, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan and terms of the Option; provided, however, that the term of this option, if it is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, may be extended for the period set forth in Section 9(i) or Section 9(ii) in the circumstances set forth in such Sections.<br><br><li>12.Early Disposition of Stock; Taxation Upon Exercise of Option</li>If Optionee is an Employee and the Option qualifies as an ISO, Optionee understands that, if Optionee disposes of any Shares received under the Option within two (2) years after the date of this Agreement or within one (1) year after such Shares were transferred to Optionee, Optionee may be treated for federal income tax purposes as having received ordinary income at the time of such disposition in any amount generally measured as the difference between the price paid for the Shares and the lower of the fair market value of the Shares at the date of exercise or the fair market value of the Shares at the of disposition.<br>Any gain recognized on such premature sale of the Shares in excess of the amount treated as ordinary income may be characterized as capital gain.<br>Optionee hereby agrees to notify the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of any such disposition.<br>Optionee understands that if Optionee disposes of such Shares at any time after the expiration of such two-year and one-year holding periods, any gain on such sale may be treated as long-term capital gain laws subject to meeting various qualifications.<br>If Optionee is a Consultant or this is a Nonstatutory Stock Option, Optionee understands that, upon exercise of the Option, Optionee may recognize income for tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the then fair market value of the Shares over the exercise price.<br>Upon a resale of such shares by the Optionee, any difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise of the Option may be treated as capital gain or loss.<br>Optionee understands that the Company may be required to withhold tax from Optionee's current compensation in some of the circumstances described above (and Optionee hereby so authorizes the Company); to the extent that Optionee's current compensation is insufficient to satisfy the withholding tax liability, the Company may require the Optionee to make a cash payment to cover such liability as a condition to exercise of the Option.<br><br><li>13.Tax Consequences</li>The Optionee understands that any of the foregoing references to taxation are based on federal income tax laws and regulations now in effect, and may not be applicable to the Optionee under certain circumstances.<br>The Optionee may also have adverse tax consequences under state or local law.<br>The Optionee has reviewed with the Optionee's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.<br>The Optionee is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents.<br>The Optionee understands that the Optionee (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Optionee's own tax liability that may arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.<br><br><li>14.Net Issue Exercise</li>Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the fair market value of one share of the Companys Common Stock is greater than the Per Share Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising the Option for cash, the Optionee may elect to receive shares equal to the value (as determined below) of the Option (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of the Option at the principal office of the Company together with the properly endorsed Notice of Exercise and Subscription Form and notice of such election, in which event the Company will issue to the Optionee a number of shares of Common Stock computed using the following formula:<br>X = Y (A-B)<br>A<br>Where X = the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Optionee<br>Y = the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable under the Option or, if only a portion of the Option is being exercised, the portion of the Option being canceled (at the date of such calculation)<br>A = the fair market value of one share of the Companys Common Stock (at the date of such calculation)<br>B = Per Share Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)<br>For purposes of the above calculation, fair market value of one share of the Companys Stock will be the average of the closing prices of the Companys shares of Common Stock as quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (the OTCBB) (or on such other United States stock exchange or public trading market or quotation medium on or by which the shares of the Company trade or are quoted if, at the time of the election, they are not trading or being quoted on the OTCBB), for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of the date the completed, executed Notice of Exercise and Subscription Form is received.<br><br><li>15.Damages</li>The parties agree that any violation of the Option (other than a default in the payment of money) cannot be compensated for by damages, and any aggrieved party shall have the right, and is hereby granted the privilege, of obtaining specific performance of the Option in any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach hereunder.<br><br><li>16.Delay</li>No delay or failure on the part of the Company or the Optionee in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any of them of any right, power or remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.<br><br><li>17.Restrictions</li>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Optionee understands and agrees that Optionee shall not dispose of any of the Shares, whether by sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, gift, devise, bequest, mortgage, pledge, encumbrance or otherwise, except in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Optionee shall not take or omit any action which will impair the absolute and unrestricted right, power, authority and capacity of Optionee to sell Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.<br><br>Any purported transfer of Shares by Optionee that violates any provision of this Section 17 shall be wholly void and ineffectual and shall give to the Company or its designee the right to purchase from Optionee all but not less than all of the Shares then owned by Optionee for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the Company first learns of the purported transfer at the Agreement Price and on the Agreement Terms (as those terms are defined in subsections (iv) and (v), respectively, of this Section 17).<br><br>The Company shall not cause or permit the transfer of any Shares to be made on its books except in accordance with the terms hereof.<br><br><ul><li>(i)Permitted Transfers</li><br><ul><li>(a)Optionee may sell, assign or transfer any Shares held by the Optionee but only by complying with the provisions of this Section 17.</li><br><br><li>(b)Upon the death of Optionee, Shares held by the Optionee may be transferred to the personal representative of the Optionee's estate.</li><br>Shares so transferred shall be subject to the provisions of the Option and this Agreement.<br><br></ul><li>(ii)Stock Certificate Legend.</li><br>Each stock certificate for Shares issued to the Optionee shall have conspicuously written, printed, typed or stamped upon the face thereof, or upon the reverse thereof with a conspicuous reference on the face thereof, one or both of the following legends:<br>THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITHOUT REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE

PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN THE COMMISSIONER'S RULES.<br><br><li>(iii)Manner of Exercise.</li><br>Any right to purchase hereunder shall be exercised by giving written notice of election to the Optionee, the Optionee's personal representative or any other selling person, as the case may be, prior to the expiration of
