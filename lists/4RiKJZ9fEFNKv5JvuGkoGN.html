Award:<br>[Number]<br>Target Award:<br>[Number]<br>Maximum Award:<br>[Number]<br>Date of Grant:<br>[Date]<br>Performance Period:<br>[Period]<br>Performance Measures<br>The Performance Period is divided into three separate periods reflecting each of the three Fiscal Years ending within the Performance Period.<br>Except as otherwise provided in this Notice, each Fiscal Year will cover one-third (1/3) of the Threshold, Target and Maximum Awards and the Award Recipient will earn between 0% and 150% of one-third (1/3) of the Target Award depending on the Company's performance against the following pre-established fully diluted earnings per share goals during each Fiscal Year ending within the Performance Period (with any fractional Share earned rounded up to a whole Share; provided that if the total Shares earned under this award would exceed the total Maximum Award specified at the top of this Notice because of such rounding, the fractional Share would be rounded down and forfeited):<br>Performance Measures - Fiscal Year One (Year Ending __________)<br>Threshold<br>Target<br>Maximum<br>Fully Diluted Earnings Per Share ("EPS")<br>50%<br>Actual EPS for the Fiscal Year ended [____] x [___]%<br>100%<br>Actual EPS for the Fiscal Year ended [____] x [___]%<br>150%<br>Actual EPS for the Fiscal Year ended [____] x [___]%<br>Performance Measures - Fiscal Year Two

[___]%<br>150%<br>Fiscal Year Two Actual EPS x [___]%<br>Except as otherwise provided in this Notice or the Agreement, in order for the Award Recipient to earn an award for a Fiscal Year, the Threshold Performance Measure must be met or exceeded; and if the Threshold Performance Measure is not met or exceeded for a Fiscal Year, no Shares will be earned under this Agreement for such Fiscal Year and the Award Recipient's Performance Share Units granted for such Fiscal Year will be cancelled and forfeited in their entirety and without payment.<br><br>The Threshold and Target performance levels (i.e., 50% and 100%) will be increased on a pro-rata basis for EPS amounts between the Threshold and Target or Target and Maximum levels, respectively, and will be rounded up to the next highest whole Share; provided that if the total Shares earned under this award would exceed the total Maximum Award specified at the top of this Notice because of such rounding, the fractional Share would be rounded down and forfeited.<br>For example, if the Threshold EPS amount is $[___], the Target EPS amount is $[___], and the actual EPS amount for Fiscal Year One is $[___], (i.e., between the Threshold and Target performance levels), the Performance Share Units will be deemed earned at a pro-rata performance level between Threshold and Target, or at [___]% ([___]% + [___]% [[___]% X $[___]/$[___]]).<br><br>Catch-Up Opportunity<br>If the actual EPS amount for Fiscal Year One or Two is below the Target Performance Measure, the Award Recipient will have an opportunity to earn the number of Shares equal to the difference between the Target Award and the Shares actually earned, if any, for Fiscal Year One or Two, as applicable, with any fractional Share rounded down and forfeited (referred to hereinafter as the "Catch-Up Shares").<br>Any Catch-up Shares from Fiscal Year One will be earned in Fiscal Year Two if the actual EPS for Fiscal Year Two equals or exceeds the actual EPS for the Fiscal Year ended [___] increased by [___]%, compounded annually.<br>Any Catch-Up Shares from Fiscal Year One or Two that were not previously earned will be earned in Fiscal Year Three if the actual EPS for Fiscal Year Three equals or exceeds the actual EPS for the Fiscal Year ended [___] increased by [___]%, compounded annually.<br>Any Catch-Up Shares earned during the Performance Period will be subject to the same vesting and delivery terms and conditions as any Shares earned in accordance with the preceding section of this Notice.<br><br>Adjustments to EPS Performance Measures<br>For purposes of the Agreement and this Notice, in determining the extent to which, if any, the EPS Performance Measures are met, the Committee shall exclude the impact of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations (including dispositions and other divestitures), extraordinary items and other unusual or non-recurring items, and the cumulative effects of accounting changes, each as defined by generally accepted accounting principles as identified in the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements or management's discussion or analysis.<br>The Committee shall not exclude the<br>impact of acquisitions or any other business combinations during the Performance Period, or any other events not expressly referenced herein.<br><br>By signing your name below, you accept this award and acknowledge and agree that this award is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of Gentiva Health Services, Inc.'s Amended and Restated 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Unit Award Agreement reference number 001, both of which are hereby made a part of this document.<br>Any capitalized terms

HEALTH SERVICES, INC.<br><br>AMENDED AND RESTATED 2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN<br>PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT<br>REFERENCE 001<br><ul><li>SECTION 1.GRANT OF PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT AWARD</li>.<br><br><ul><li>(a) Performance Share Unit Award</li>On the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and each Notice of Performance Share Unit Award referencing this Agreement (the "Notice"), the Company hereby grants the Award Recipient a performance grant in the form of Performance Share Units.<br>Each Performance Share Unit award under this Agreement shall represent a right to receive one Share of the Company's common stock, par value $.10 per share, to the extent such Performance Share Unit is earned and vested pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.<br>Each Notice, together with this referenced Agreement, shall be a separate Performance Share Unit award governed by the terms of this Agreement.<br><br><li>(b) Equity Incentive Plan and Defined Terms</li>This award is granted under and subject to the terms of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by this reference.<br>Capitalized terms are defined in Section 7 of this Agreement.<br><br></ul><li>SECTION 2.PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS</li><br><ul><li>(a) Target Award</li>The Target Award means the target number of Performance Share Units covered by and subject to the terms of this Agreement as set forth in

Performance Period</li>The Performance Period means the performance period as set forth in the Notice.<br><br><li>(c) Performance Measures</li>Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall issue and deliver to the Award Recipient one (1) Share for each whole Performance Share Unit that is earned in accordance with the Performance Measures set forth in the Notice; provided, however, that the Committee may reduce the number of Performance Share Units earned under this Award, but in no event may the Committee increase the number of Performance Share Units earned under this Award beyond the performance levels achieved.<br><br><li>(d) Dividend Equivalent Rights</li>If a regular cash dividend is declared on the Company's Shares during a Performance Period with respect to which an Award Recipient earns a Performance Share Unit (even if the Award Recipient earns the Performance Share Unit for such Performance Period after the date the regular cash dividend is declared), a notional account shall be maintained for the Award Recipient under this Award and shall be credited with the amount of regular dividends that would have been paid to the Award Recipient on such Performance Share Units if they had been earned and the underlying Shares had been issued to the Award Recipient immediately before the regular cash dividend had been declared; provided that, if the Notice provides that specific Performance Share Units shall be earned for specific Fiscal Years ending within the Performance Period or other separately designed Performance Periods, the<br>dividend equivalent rights shall be determined separately for each Fiscal Year (or other separately designated Performance Period) so that dividend equivalent rights shall be credited with respect to Performance Share Units only for regular cash dividends declared for the Fiscal Year (or other separately designated Performance Period) for which the Performance Share Unit is earned and any regular cash dividends declared thereafter and before the related Shares are delivered to the Award Recipient.<br>Any such dividend equivalent amounts credited to the Award Recipient's notional account hereunder shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any applicable vesting requirements, forfeiture provisions or catch-up opportunities) as the Performance Share Units with respect to which the dividend equivalent amounts were originally credited.<br>To the extent any dividend equivalent amounts are earned and vested, the dividend equivalent amounts shall be paid in a single, lump sum payment in cash at the same time as the related Shares are delivered to the Award Recipient.<br><br></ul><li>SECTION 3.SEPARATION FROM

(including any dividend equivalent rights credited pursuant to Section 2(d) above), whether earned or unearned, shall be automatically cancelled and forfeited in their entirety without any further obligation on the part of the Company, such that the Company shall not be obligated to issue any Shares or any other compensation to Award Recipient with respect to such cancelled and forfeited Performance Share Units.<br><br><li>(b) Death, Disability and Certain Involuntary Separations from Service</li>If during the Performance Period (i) the Award Recipient Separates from Service as a result of the Award Recipient's Disability or death, or (ii) the Award Recipient experiences an involuntary Separation from Service by the Company on account of the Award Recipient's position being eliminated by the Company or a reduction in force by the Company affecting multiple positions, the Award Recipient shall be entitled to receive the portion of the Performance Share Units earned, if any, before such Separation from Service pursuant to Section 2(c) above.<br>Any Shares to which Award Recipient becomes entitled to receive pursuant to the preceding sentence will be issued and delivered to Award Recipient as soon as administratively practicable following such Separation from Service, but in no event later than March 15th of the calendar year beginning closest to the end of the Fiscal Year in which the Award Recipient Separates from Service; provided, however, that no certificate(s) for, or other evidence of ownership of, Shares shall be delivered with respect to

achieved.<br>Any delivery of shares on account of the Award Recipient's death shall be made to the Award Recipient's estate.<br><br><li>(c) Change of Control</li>In the event that a Change in Control occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that have been earned for any Fiscal Year ending before such Change in Control plus any Performance Share Units at the Target Award level for any Fiscal Year ending after such Change in Control that have not been previously cancelled and forfeited shall become fully vested and payable (and the Performance Period shall thereafter be deemed to have terminated).<br>Any Shares to which the Award Recipient becomes entitled to receive pursuant to the preceding sentence will be issued and delivered to the Award Recipient contemporaneously with the consummation of the Change of Control.<br><br></ul><li>SECTION 4.DELIVERY OF SHARES AND TAXES</li>.<br><br><ul><li>(a) Delivery of Shares</li>Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding requirements set forth in subsection (b) below, the Company shall cause stock certificate(s) or other evidence of ownership representing the number of Shares earned and vested and determined under Section 2(c) to be delivered to the Award Recipient in the calendar year beginning closest to the end of the Performance Period, but no later than March 15th of such calendar year; provided, however, that: (i) except as provided below, no certificate(s) for, or other evidence of ownership of, Shares shall be delivered with respect to Performance Share Units unless the Committee has certified in writing that the applicable Performance Measures set forth in the Notice and other material terms of this Agreement have been achieved; and (ii) the Company shall not deliver stock certificate(s) or other evidence of ownership representing Shares if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the delivery of
