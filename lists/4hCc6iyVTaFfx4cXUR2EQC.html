Company to protect the Company, the Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced.<br>The Company may charge a Holder for the Companys expenses in replacing a Note.<br><br>Every replacement Note of a series is an additional obligation of the Company and will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture equally and

by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding.<br>Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof or in any provision of the form of Note that so expressly states, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Note.<br><br>If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.<br><br>If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.<br><br>If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes will be deemed to be no longer outstanding and will cease to accrue interest.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 2.09 Treasury Notes</li><br>In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes of a series have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Company, or by any Affiliate of the Company, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded.<br><br>12<br></ul><ul><li>Section 2.10 Temporary Notes</li><br>Until certificated Notes are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate temporary Notes.<br>Temporary Notes will be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.<br>Without unreasonable delay, the Company will prepare and the Trustee will authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes.<br><br>Holders of temporary Notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 2.11 Cancellation</li><br>The Company at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation.<br>The Registrar and Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment.<br>The Trustee and no one else will cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will dispose of such canceled Notes (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act) in its customary manner.<br>The Company may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest</li><br>If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a series of Notes, it will pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.<br>The Company will notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note of such series and the date of the proposed payment.<br>The Company will fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date; provided that no such special record date may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.<br>At least 15 days before the special record date, the Company (or, upon the written request of the Company, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company) will mail or cause to be mailed to Holders of such series of Notes a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 2.13 CUSIP Numbers</li><br>The Company in issuing the Notes may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.<br>The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.<br><br>ARTICLE 3<br>REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT<br><li>Section 3.01 Optional Redemption</li><br>Notes of any series that are

series as follows:<br>(1) if such Notes are listed, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which such Notes are listed, or<br>(2) if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate.<br><br>In the event of partial redemption or purchase by lot, the particular Notes of any series to be redeemed or purchased will be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 35 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption or purchase date by the Trustee from the outstanding Notes of such series not previously called for redemption or purchase.<br><br>The Trustee will promptly notify the Company in writing of the Notes selected for redemption or purchase and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption or purchase, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed or purchased.<br>Notes of a series and portions of such Notes selected will be in

registered at the close of business on such record date.<br>If any Note called for redemption or purchase is not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption or purchase date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not

failure by the Company to comply with any of its other agreements in this Indenture (other than an agreement that has been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Notes other than such series) or the Notes of such series for 60 days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee or by Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding voting as a single class;<br>(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date such series of Notes was first issued;<br><ul><li>(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest, if any, on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a Payment Default), or</li><li>(B) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness

amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series may declare the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, on all the Notes of such series then outstanding to be due and payable, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by Holders) specifying the Event of Default and that it is a notice of acceleration and upon delivery of such notice the principal amount, in either case, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, on all the Notes of such series then outstanding will become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary.<br>Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default specified in clause (6) or (7) of Section 6.01 hereof, the principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and premium and Additional Interest, if any, will immediately and

provided in this Indenture.<br><br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03, and for any failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a) of the TIA, will for the 365 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default consist exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the principal amount of the Notes of such series at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum.<br>This Additional Interest will be payable in the same manner and subject to the same terms as other interest payable under this Indenture.<br>The Additional Interest will accrue on all outstanding Notes of such series from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03 or Section 314(a) of the TIA first occurs to but not excluding the 365th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to the reporting obligations described under Section 4.03 or Section 314(a) of the TIA shall have been cured or waived).<br>On such 365th day (or earlier, if the Event of Default relating to such reporting obligations is cured or waived prior to such 365th day), such Additional Interest will cease to accrue and the Notes of such series will be subject to the other remedies as provided under this Section 6.02 if the Event of Default is continuing.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph will not affect the rights of Holders of Notes of such series in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default.<br><br>The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Notes of such series, rescind an acceleration and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or Additional Interest, if any, that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.<br><br>19<br></ul><ul><li>Section 6.03 Other Remedies</li><br>If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of a series occurs and is continuing, the

such application, then the Companys obligations under this Indenture and the applicable Notes will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium or Additional Interest, if any, or interest on, any such Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company will be subrogated to the rights of the

any distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a proceeding under Bankruptcy Law relating to the Company or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Companys assets and liabilities:<br>(1) holders of Senior Debt will be entitled to receive payment in full of all Obligations in respect of such Senior Debt (including Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) and to have all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations fully cash collateralized before the Trustee or the Holders will be entitled to receive any payment or distribution on Obligations with respect to the Notes (except that the Trustee or the Holders may receive payments and other distributions made from any defeasance or redemption trust created pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 hereof and the issuance of Permitted Junior Securities); and<br>(2) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in clause (1) above) are paid in full and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations are fully cash collateralized, any distribution to which the Trustee or the

Obligations arising under or in connection with the Notes and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property (other than payments and other distributions made from any defeasance or redemption trust created pursuant to Articles 8 or 12 hereof and the issuance of Permitted Junior Securities) until all principal and other Obligations arising under or in connection with the Senior Debt have been paid in full or fully cash-collateralized, if not yet due if:</li>(1) a default in the payment of any Obligations with respect to Designated Senior Debt occurs and is continuing (including any default in payment upon the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise), or any judicial proceeding is pending to determine whether any such default has occurred; or<br>(2) a default or event of default (as such terms may be defined in any agreement, indenture or other document governing such Designated Senior Debt), other than a payment default described in subsection (1) above, on Designated Senior Debt, including any default or event of default that would result upon any payment or distribution with respect to the Notes, that would cause or permit the acceleration of the maturity of the Designated Senior Debt, occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that permits holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default (a Payment Blockage Notice) from the Company or the holders of any Designated Senior Debt.<br>If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice will be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until at least 360 days will have elapsed since the first day of effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice.<br>No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee will be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default will have been waived for a period of not less than 180 days.<br><br>If the Company is prohibited from making payments on or distributions in respect of the Notes or from acquiring any Notes under subsection (1) or (2) above, the Company may and will resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon:<br><ul><li>(A) in the case of any prohibition referred to in Section 10.</li>31<br><li>(B) in the case of any prohibition referred to in Section 10.</li><br></ul></ul><ul><li>Section 10.04 Acceleration of Notes</li><br>If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company will promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.05 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over</li><br>If, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.02 and 10.03, any direct or indirect payment or distribution on account of principal of or interest on or other Obligations with respect to the Notes or acquisition, repurchase, redemption, retirement or defeasance of any of the Notes will be made by or on behalf of the Company (including any payments or distribution by any liquidating trustee or agent or other Person in a proceeding referred to in Section 10.02) and received by the Trustee or any Holder at a time when such payment or distribution was prohibited by the provisions of Section 10.02 or 10.03 or such payment or distribution was required to be made to holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives, then, unless and until such payment or distribution is no longer prohibited by Section 10.02 or 10.03, such payment or distribution will be received, segregated from other funds or assets and held in trust by the Trustee or such Holder, as the case may be, for the benefit of, and will be immediately paid or delivered over to, those Persons known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, as, or identified by the Company as, or to a fund for the benefit of, the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives, ratably in accordance with the respective amounts of the principal of such Senior Debt, interest (including, without limitation, Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) thereon and all other Obligations with respect thereto held or represented by each, until the principal of all Senior Debt, interest (including Accrued Bankruptcy Interest) thereon and all other Obligations with respect thereto have been paid in full and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations and applicable Hedging Obligations have been fully cash collateralized.<br>Any distribution to the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives of assets other than cash may be held by such holders or such Representatives as additional collateral without any duty to the Holder to liquidate or otherwise realize on such assets or to apply such assets to any Senior Debt or other Obligations relating thereto.<br><br>With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt will be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.<br>The Trustee will not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and will not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee in good faith mistakenly pays over or distributes to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt are entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.<br>Nothing in this Section 10.05 will affect the obligation of any Person other than the Trustee to hold such payment or distribution for the benefit of, and to pay or deliver such payment or distribution over to, the holders of Senior Debt or their Representatives.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.06 Notice by Company</li><br>The Company will promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice will not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article 10.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.07 Subrogation</li><br>After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders will be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt.<br>A distribution made under this Article to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on the Notes.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.08 Relative Rights</li><br>This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Debt.<br>Nothing in this Article 10 will:<br>(1) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest and Additional Interest, if any, on, the Notes in accordance with their terms;<br>32<br>(2) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or<br>(3) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders.<br><br>If the Company fails because of this Article to pay principal of or interest or Additional Interest, if any, on, a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.09 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by the Company</li><br>No right of any present or future holder of Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes will be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder of Notes or any holder of Senior Debt or by the failure of the Company or any Holder of Notes or any holder of Senior Debt to comply with this Indenture regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such Holder of Notes or holder of Senior Debt, as the case may be, may have or be otherwise charged with.<br>The holders of Senior Debt may extend, renew, restate, supplement, modify or amend the terms of the Senior Debt or any Obligations with respect thereto or any security therefor and release, sell or exchange such security and otherwise deal freely with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates all without affecting the liabilities and obligations of the parties to this Indenture or the Holders.<br>No provision in any supplemental indenture that adversely affects the subordination of the Notes or other provisions of this Article 10 will be effective against the holders of the Designated Senior Debt unless the requisite percentage of such holders (or if permitted under the applicable Senior Debt governing agreement, the Representative) will have consented thereto.<br><br>Each Holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof: (a) acknowledges and agrees that the holders of any Senior Debt or their Representative, in its or their discretion, and without affecting any rights of any holder of Senior Debt under this Article 10, may foreclose any mortgage or deed of trust covering interest in real property securing such Senior Debt or any guarantee thereof by judicial or nonjudicial sale, even though such action may release the Company or any guarantor of such Senior Debt from further liability under such Senior Debt or any guarantee thereof or may otherwise limit the remedies available to the holders thereof; and (b) hereby waives any defense that such Holder may otherwise have to the enforcement of this Article 10 by any holder of any Senior Debt or any Representative of such holder against such Holder after or as a result of any action, including any such defense based on any loss or impairment of rights of subrogation.<br><br>If at any time any payment of Obligations with respect to any Senior Debt is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation of the Company or otherwise, the provisions of this Article 10 will continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may be, to the same extent as though such payments had not been made.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.10 Distribution or Notice to Representative</li><br>Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.<br><br>Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders will be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.<br><br>Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee will be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee or agent on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior Debt (or a trustee or agent on behalf of any such holder).<br>In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article 10, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article 10, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment which it may be required to make for the benefit of such Person pursuant to the terms of this Indenture pending judicial determination as to the rights of such Person to receive such payment.<br><br>33<br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.11 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent</li><br>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received at its Corporate Trust Office at least two Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article.<br>Only the Company or a Representative may give the notice.<br>Nothing in this Article 10 will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.<br><br>The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.<br>Any Agent may do the same with like rights.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.12 Authorization to Effect Subordination</li><br>Each Holder of a Note by the Holders acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on the Holders behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as the Holders attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.<br><br>The Company, the Trustee and each Holder by their acceptance of the Notes acknowledge that damages may be inadequate to compensate the holders of Senior Debt for any breach or default by the Company, the Trustee or any such Holder of its obligations under this Article 10, and, therefore, agree that the holders of Senior Debt and their Representatives will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the enforcement thereof.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 10.13 Amendments</li><br>The provisions of this Article 10 will not be amended or modified without the written consent of the holders of all Senior Debt (or their Representatives as permitted thereunder) unless such amendment or modification does not adversely affect the holders of such Senior Debt.<br><br>ARTICLE
