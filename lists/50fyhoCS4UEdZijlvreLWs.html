Grant) by the Compensation Committee of the Disney Board of Directors (the Committee) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated 2002 Executive Performance Plan (the Plan), and pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the Stock Plan).<br>The applicable terms of the Plan and the Stock Plan are incorporated herein by reference, including the definitions of terms contained therein.<br><br><ul><li>Section 1.Stock Unit Award.</li><br>Disney hereby grants to the Participant, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, an Award for a target number of Stock

thereto (as dividend equivalents) pursuant to Section 4 hereof, being referred to herein as the Target Award Amount).<br>The number of Stock Units which may be awarded hereunder is dependent upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and may range from no Stock Units to 150% of the Target Award Amount.<br>The Stock Units are notional units of measurement denominated in Shares of Disney (i.e. one Stock Unit is equivalent in value to one Share, subject to the terms hereof).<br>The Stock Units represent an unfunded, unsecured obligation of Disney.<br><br><li>Section 2.Vesting Requirements.</li><br>The vesting of this Award (other than pursuant to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as provided in Section 3 below) shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in subsections A, B and C of this Section 2:<br><ul><li>A.Total Shareholder Return/EPS Growth Test.</li><br>The vesting of the Stock Units subject to this Award shall be conditioned upon the satisfaction of either (i) a performance vesting requirement based on Total Shareholder Return (as hereinafter defined) of Disney as compared to the Total Shareholder Returns of the S&P 500 Companies (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the three-year period ending on the Determination Date (as hereinafter defined), all as further provided below in Section 2.A(a) hereof (the TSR Performance Requirement) OR (ii) under certain circumstances provided for below, a performance vesting requirement based upon the Disney Adjusted EPS Growth Rate (as defined below) as compared to the EPS Growth Rates of the S&P 500 Companies (subject to certain exclusions as hereinafter provided), all as further provided in Section 2.A(b) hereof (the EPS Growth Performance Requirement).<br><br><ul><li>(a)Total Shareholder Return: Three-Year Test.</li><br>In order for the TSR Performance Requirement to be satisfied pursuant to this Section 2.A(a) with respect to any Stock Units subject to this Award, the TSR Percentile (as hereinafter defined) of Disney must equal or exceed the TSR Percentile of 25.00% of the S&P 500 Companies (the S&P 25th TSR Percentile).<br>If this requirement is met, the specific number of Stock Units subject to this Award which shall satisfy the TSR Performance Requirement shall be determined as follows:<br></ul></ul></ul><ul><li>i.If the TSR Percentile of Disney is 25.</li>00% (the S&P 25th TSR Percentile), then the number of Stock Units which shall satisfy the TSR Performance Requirement shall be 50% of the Target Award Amount.<br><br>ii.<br><br>If the TSR Percentile of Disney equals or exceeds the TSR Percentile of 75.00% of the S&P 500 Companies (the S&P 75th TSR Percentile), the number of Stock Units which shall satisfy the TSR Performance Requirement shall be 150% of the Target Award Amount.<br><br>iii.<br><br>If the TSR Percentile of Disney exceeds the S&P 25th Percentile but is less than the S&P 75th Percentile, the percentage of Stock Units as to which the TSR Performance Requirement shall have been satisfied shall be determined by multiplying the TSR Percentile of Disney by two.<br>For example, if the TSR Percentile of Disney is 40.00%, then Stock Units equal to 80% of the Target Award Amount shall have satisfied the TSR Performance Requirement; if the TSR Percentile of Disney is 60.55%, then 121.10% of the Target Award Amount shall have satisfied the TSR Performance Requirement.<br><br>For the purposes hereof, the terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:<br>Determination Date shall mean the date which precedes the Scheduled Vesting Date (as hereinafter defined) by one month.<br>For example, for an Award vesting on a January 14 of any specified year, the Determination Date of such Award is December 14 of the prior year.<br><br>2<br>Total Shareholder Return shall mean an amount equal to the average of the total return figures for the three-year periods ending on the twenty (20) trading days referred to below as currently reported under Comparative Returns by Bloomberg L.P.<br>(Bloomberg) (or any other reporting service that the Committee may designate from time to time):<br><ul><li>(i)for Disney (as such total return figures for Disney may be adjusted by the Committee, by no later than the Scheduled Vesting Date, to take into account any factors which the Committee has determined are not properly reflected in such reported figures) or</li><br><li>(ii)for any other S&P 500 Company,</li><br>in each case for the twenty (20) latest trading days up to and (if the Determination Date is a trading day) including the Determination Date.<br><br>TSR Percentile shall mean the percentile ranking (which shall be carried out to two decimal points) as determined by Disney on the basis of the Total Shareholder Return figures reported by Bloomberg (or any other reporting service that the Committee may designate from time to time) for each of the S&P 500 Companies, including Disney (provided that in the case of Disney adjustments may be made by the Committee with respect to Total Shareholder Return as provided above).<br><br>S&P 500 Companies shall mean all of the companies which are listed on the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Index, including Disney, on the date which is three years and twenty (20) trading days prior to the Determination Date and which remain continuously listed on the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Index through and including the Determination Date; provided however, that for the purposes hereof the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Index shall be deemed to include companies that were removed therefrom during the measurement period but that continued during the entire measurement period to have their shares listed on at least one of the NYSE, NASDAQ, American Stock Exchange, Boston Stock Exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchanged (formerly Cincinnati Stock Exchange), NYSE Arca (formerly known as the Pacific Stock Exchange), Philadelphia Stock Exchange or any other exchange(s) that the Committee may designate from time to time.<br><br></ul></ul><ul><li>(b)EPS</li>Growth Test .<br>If the Award will not vest, or shall not have vested, on the Scheduled Vesting Date with respect to at least 100% of the Target Award Amount by reason of the non-satisfaction of any vesting requirement set forth above in Section 2.A(a) hereof, then the Committee shall, no later than the Scheduled Vesting Date, determine whether or not the Disney Adjusted EPS Growth Rate (as defined below) for the twelve (12) fiscal quarters reported on or before the Determination Date equals or exceeds the EPS Growth Rate (as<br>3<br>defined below) of 50% of the S&P 500 Companies over the same period (the S&P 50th Percentile for Average Annualized EPS Growth Rate).<br>If the Committee determines that the Disney Adjusted EPS Growth Rate for such period is equal to or greater than the S&P 50th Percentile for EPS Growth Rate, then the percentage of the Target Award Amount of Stock Units which shall satisfy the performance requirement of this Section 2.A(b) (the EPS Growth Performance Requirement) shall be 50%, unless the TSR Percentile of Disney determined pursuant to Section 2.A(a) above shall be greater than or equal to 25.00%, in which case the percentage of the Target Award Amount of Stock Units which shall satisfy the EPS Growth Performance Requirement shall be equal to the TSR Percentile of Disney plus 50 (it being understood for the avoidance of doubt that the percentage of the Target Award Amount of the Stock Units vesting hereunder by operation of the EPS Growth Performance Requirement cannot under any circumstances exceed 100%).<br>Thus, for example, if the TSR Percentile for Disney determined pursuant to Section 2.A(a) above is 5.50% and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is satisfied, then 50% of the Target Award Amount of Stock Units shall satisfy the EPS Growth Performance Requirement, and if the TSR Percentile of Disney is 37.50%, then 87.50% of the Target Award Amount of Stock Units shall satisfy the EPS Growth Performance Requirement.<br><br>For the purposes hereof, the terms set forth below shall have the following meanings:<br>Disney Adjusted EPS Growth Rate shall mean the compound annual growth rate of the Disney Adjusted EPS (as defined below) for the twelve (12) fiscal quarters of Disney ended immediately prior to the Determination Date for which financial results have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (the Disney EPS Growth Performance Period).<br>For the avoidance of doubt, the Disney Adjusted EPS Growth Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the Disney Adjusted EPS for the four fiscal quarters prior to the Disney EPS Growth Performance Period as compared to Disney Adjusted EPS for the final four quarters of the Disney EPS Growth Performance Period.<br><br>Disney Adjusted EPS shall mean the EPS of Disney, after such adjustments thereto as the Committee deems appropriate in its sole discretion (i) to exclude the effect of extraordinary, unusual and/or nonrecurring items and (ii) to reflect such other factors as the Committee deems appropriate to fairly reflect earnings per share growth.<br><br>4<br>EPS Growth Rate shall mean the compound annual growth rate of EPS (as defined below) for the twelve (12) most recent fiscal quarters ended immediately prior to the Determination Date (the S&P 500 EPS Growth Performance Period) as determined on the basis of EPS reported on or prior to the Determination Date by Bloomberg (or any other reporting service that the Committee may designate from time to time) for any of the S&P 500 Companies other than (i) Disney and (ii) any S&P 500 Company with negative EPS (as reported by Bloomberg or any other reporting service that the Committee may designate from time to time) for the four fiscal quarters (in the aggregate) prior to the S&P 500 EPS Growth Performance Period (unless otherwise provided by the Committee on a case by case basis) (the EPS for any such four quarters (whether or not negative) being referred to herein as the Starting EPS).<br>For the avoidance of doubt, the EPS Growth Rate of any S&P 500 Company shall be calculated on the basis of the Starting EPS of such company as compared to its EPS for the final four quarters of the S&P 500 EPS Growth Performance Period.<br><br>EPS shall mean the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for any company for a specified period as reported by Bloomberg (or any other reporting service that the Committee may designate from time to time).<br><br><li>(c)Satisfaction of Section 2.</li>A Vesting Requirement.<br>In the event that the EPS Growth Performance Requirement has been satisfied in accordance with Section 2.A(b) hereof with respect to any number of Stock Units, then such number of Stock Units shall be deemed to have satisfied the performance vesting requirement of this Section 2.A in lieu of any lesser number of Stock Units determined to have satisfied the TSR Performance Requirement pursuant to Section 2.A(a).<br>In the event that the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is not satisfied or is not required to be applied pursuant to Section 2.A(b) hereof, the number of Stock Units, if any, which shall satisfy the performance vesting requirement of this Section 2.A shall be the number of Stock Units determined pursuant to Section 2.A(a) hereof.<br>For the avoidance of doubt regarding the application of the TSR Performance Requirement and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement, the following example ranges of results are given:<br><ul><li>(i)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is less than the S&P 25th TSR Percentile, and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is not met, the number of Stock Units vesting is zero.</li><br><br>5<br><li>(ii)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is less than the S&P 25th TSR Percentile and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is met, the percentage of Stock Units vesting is 50% of the Target Award Amount.</li><br><br><li>(iii)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is equal to or greater than the S&P 25th TSR Percentile but less than 50.</li>00%, and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is not met, the percentage of the Target Award Amount vesting is equal to the TSR Percentile of Disney multiplied by two.<br><br><li>(iv)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is equal to or greater than the S&P 25th TSR Percentile but less than 50.</li>00%, and the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is met, then the percentage of the Target Award Amount vesting is equal to the TSR Percentile of Disney plus 50.<br><br><li>(v)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is equal to or greater than 50.</li>00% but less than 75.00%, then the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is not applicable, then the percentage of the Target Award Amount vesting is equal to the TSR Percentile of Disney multiplied by two.<br><br><li>(vi)If the TSR Percentile of Disney is equal to or greater than 75.</li>00%, then the EPS Growth Performance Requirement is not applicable and the percentage of Stock Units vesting is equal to 150% of the Target Award Amount.<br><br></ul></ul><ul><li>B.Section 162(m) Vesting Requirement.</li><br>This Award shall also be subject to additional performance vesting requirements under this Section 2.B with respect to all Stock Units subject to this Award, based upon the achievement of the Performance Target applicable to the Performance Period set forth below, and subject to certification of achievement of such Performance Target by the Committee pursuant to Section

the terms and conditions of Section 2 hereof, upon the Participants death or disability (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), or upon the occurrence of a Triggering Event within the 12-month period following a Change in Control in accordance with Section 11 of the Stock Plan as in effect as of the date of the Triggering Event (any of the foregoing being an Accelerating Event) (provided, in each case, that the Participant is employed by Disney (or an Affiliate) at the time of such Accelerating Event), this Award shall become fully vested with respect to the Target
