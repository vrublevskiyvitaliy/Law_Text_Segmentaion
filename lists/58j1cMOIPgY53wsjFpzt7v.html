be deemed to constitute Landlords approval of such transfer.<br>In no event may Tenant sublease any portion of the Premises or assign the Lease to any other tenant of the Building unless Landlord does not have space in the Building to reasonably accommodate such tenant.<br>Tenant shall submit for Landlords approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) any advertising which Tenant or its agents intend to use with respect to the space proposed to be sublet.<br><br><li>(b) With respect to Landlords consent to an assignment or sublease, Landlord may take

proposed assignee or sublessee would diminish the value or reputation of the Building, the Project or Landlord; (iii) any proposed assignees or sublessees use of the Premises would violate Section

which Landlord may have consented.<br><br><li>(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article Ten, Tenant shall have the right, without the prior written consent of Landlord, to sublease the Premises or any portion thereof to an Affiliate or Successor or to assign this Lease to an Affiliate or Successor, but (i) no later than ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the assignment or sublease, the assignee or sublessee shall execute documents satisfactory to Landlord to evidence such subtenant or assignees assumption of the obligations and liabilities of

reorganization; (ii) within ten (10) days after the effective date of such assignment or sublease, give notice to Landlord which notice shall include the full name and address of the assignee or

Premises by any lawful means, and remove Tenants property, fixtures, furnishings, signs and other evidences of tenancy, and take and hold such property; provided, however, that such entry and

commercially reasonable</li>In the event the trustee elects to reject this Lease then Landlord shall immediately be entitled to possession of the Premises without further obligation to Tenant or the

appointments within twenty (20) days after Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree upon the Prevailing Market Rate.<br>The two (2) appraisers selected by Landlord and Tenant shall select the third appraiser within ten (10) days after they both have been appointed, and each appraiser, within fifteen (15) days after the third appraiser is elected, shall submit his or her determination of the Prevailing Market Rate.<br>The Prevailing Market Rate shall be the determination of the appraiser that is not the highest or the lowest (or, if two (2) appraisers reach an identical determination, the determination of such two (2) appraisers), which determination shall be final and binding on Landlord and Tenant.<br>Landlord and Tenant shall each pay the fee of the appraiser selected by it, and they shall equally share the payment of the fee of the third.<br><br><li>26.28 SURRENDER OPTION -</li><ul><li>(a) Tenant shall have a one-time option to surrender up to ten percent (10%) of the Premises, the exact location and dimensions of such space to be mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant (so that such space surrendered is of a reasonably marketable size and configuration) within thirty (30) days after Landlord receives the Surrender Notice (the Surrender Space), effective as of the end of the full sixtieth (60th) month after Commencement Date (the Surrender Date) by providing Landlord with written notice of such election (the Surrender Notice) no less than six (6) months prior to the Surrender Date (the Surrender Notice Deadline).</li>If Tenant has not given the Surrender Notice to Landlord prior to the Surrender Notice Deadline, the Surrender Option shall terminate and be null and void, and Tenant shall have no right or option to surrender the Surrender Space pursuant to this Section 26.28(a).<br>As a condition precedent to any surrender of the Surrender Space pursuant to the provisions of this Section 26.28(a), Tenant must deliver to Landlord, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Surrender Notice, in addition to any and all due but unpaid Rent due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease as of the date of such delivery (include any Default Rate interest payable on such Rent as of the date of such delivery), a surrender fee equal to the sum of (i) four (4) months of Monthly Base Rent and Tenants Share of Operating Expenses and Taxes for the Surrender Space at the rate payable immediately prior to the Surrender Date, (ii) the unamortized prorated Tenant Improvement Allowance and the Additional Tenant Improvement Allowance for the Surrender Space as of the Surrender Date, amortized on a straight-line basis using an interest rate of eight percent (8%), and (iii) the unamortized prorated leasing commissions for the Surrender Space as of the Surrender Date, amortized on a straight-line basis using an interest rate of eight percent (8%).<br>It is hereby acknowledged that any such amount required to be paid by Tenant in connection with such early surrender of the Surrender Space is not a penalty but a reasonable pre-estimate of the damages which would be incurred by Landlord as a result of such early surrender of the Surrender Space (which damages are impossible to calculate more precisely) and, in that regard, constitutes liquidated damages with respect to such loss.<br>Tenant shall continue to be liable for Tenants obligations under this Lease with respect to the Surrender Space to and through the Surrender Date including, with all of such obligations surviving the Surrender Date.<br>As of the Surrender Date, Tenant shall surrender and relinquish the Surrender Space in accordance with the terms of this Lease and shall therefore have no further rights with respect thereto.<br>Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Surrender Notice to Landlord, Landlord and Tenant shall execute an amendment modifying the terms of this Lease to reflect the surrender of the Surrender Space on the terms set forth in this Section 26.28(a).<br><br>47<br><li>(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 26.28, as a condition to the surrender of the Surrender Space to be effective, (i) any Surrender Space shall be located entirely on the same floor of the Building, (ii) in the event that the Premises contain a partial floor in the Building as of the date of the Surrender Notice, such Surrender Space shall only contain space in the Premises on such partial floor, and such Surrender Space, as well as any other space on such partial floor not leased to Tenant shall be a marketable unit, as reasonably determined by Landlord, and otherwise in compliance with all Laws, and (iii) in the event that the Premises does not contain any partial floors in the Building as of the date of the Surrender Notice, such Surrender Space, as well as any other space on such floor not leased to Tenant shall be a marketable unit, as reasonably determined by Landlord, and otherwise in compliance with all Laws.</li><br><li>(c) If Landlord consents to any assignment or subletting of this Lease, except for a transfer permitted pursuant to Section 10.01(d) of this Lease, Tenants rights with respect to the Surrender Option shall not be transferable or assignable to an assignee or subtenant without the express prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be granted, withheld or conditioned in Landlords sole and absolute discretion.</li><br></ul><li>26.29 INTENTIONALLY DELETED</li><li>26.30 RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL -</li><ul><li>(a) So long as this Lease is in full force and

conditions upon which it would be willing to lease such Right of First Refusal Space to Tenant (the Right of First Refusal).</li><br><li>(b) If within five (5) business days after receipt of the Right of First Refusal Notice, Tenant agrees in writing to lease such Right of First Refusal Space upon all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Right of First Refusal Notice (including for the full term set forth in the Right of First Refusal Notice), which writing shall constitute Tenants binding commitment to lease such Right of First Refusal Space upon such terms, Landlord and Tenant will execute an amendment to this Lease with respect to such Right of First Refusal Space within ten (10) business days after Landlords receipt of Tenants notice of intent to lease such Right of First Refusal Space on the same terms as contained in the Right of First Refusal Notice.</li><br><li>(c) If Tenant does not deliver its notice of intent to lease such Right of First Refusal Space on the same terms as the Right of First Refusal Notice within such five (5) business day period, or Tenant fails to execute an amendment to this Lease with respect to such Right of First Refusal Space within the longer of (i) ten (10) business days after Landlords receipt of Tenants notice of intent to lease such Right of First Refusal Space on the same terms as contained in the Right of First Refusal Notice and (ii) five (5) business days after Tenants receipt of the amendment from Landlord (the Amendment Review Period), then Landlord may lease such Right of First Refusal Space to a third-party on economic terms and conditions (i.e. rent, concessions (including, without limitation, free rent), tenant improvement allowance and other allowances) that are no more than ten percent (10%) less than the economic terms and conditions offered to Tenant.</li>If Landlord fails, within one hundred eighty (180) days of Tenants failure to exercise such Right of<br>48<br>First Refusal, to lease such Right of First Refusal Space on the economic terms and conditions offered to Tenant, subject to the variance set forth in the preceding sentence, such Right of First Refusal Space shall again become subject to the Right of First Refusal.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that Tenant fails or refuses to execute any such amendment with respect to any particular Right of First Refusal Space within the Amendment Review Period, which failure is not cured within three (3) business days after a second notice to Tenant, Tenants Right of First Refusal with respect to that specific Right of First Refusal Space shall automatically terminate, and Tenant shall no longer have a Right of First Refusal as to such specific Right of First Refusal Space, and (ii) in the event Tenant, on two separate occasions during the Term, exercises its Right of First Refusal and then fails or refuses to execute an amendment with respect to the applicable Right of First Refusal Space within the Amendment Review Period, which failure is not cured within three (3) business days after second notice to Tenant, Tenants Right of First Refusal shall automatically terminate and Tenant shall no longer have a Right of First Refusal as to any Right of First Refusal Space; provided, however, the Amendment Review Period referenced in this sentence shall be extended for any periods during which Tenant is negotiating, in good faith, the form and substance of any such amendment.<br><br><li>(d) If Landlord consents to any assignment or subletting of this Lease, except for a transfer permitted pursuant to Section 10.01(d) of this Lease, Tenants rights with respect to the Right of First Refusal shall not be transferable or assignable to an assignee or subtenant without the express prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be granted, withheld or conditioned in Landlords sole and absolute discretion.</li><br></ul><li>26.31 ATTORNEYS FEES - If either Landlord
