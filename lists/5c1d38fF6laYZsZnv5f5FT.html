share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property (in any such case, a "Fundamental Transaction"), this Note, as to the unpaid principal portion thereof and accrued interest thereon, shall thereafter be deemed to evidence the right to convert into such number and kind of shares or other securities and property as would have been issuable or distributable on account of such Fundamental Transaction, upon or with respect to the secur ities subject to the conversion right immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction.<br>The foregoing provision shall similarly apply to successive Fundamental Transactions of a similar nature by any such successor or purchaser.<br>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the anti-dilution provisions of this Section shall apply to such securities of such successor or purchaser after any such Fundamental Transaction.<br><br><li>B.Reclassification,

or outstanding, this Note, as to the unpaid principal portion thereof and accrued interest thereon, shall thereafter be deemed to evidence the right to purchase an adjusted number of such securities and kind of securities as would have been issuable as the result of such change with respect to the Common Stock immediately prior to such reclassification or other change.<br><br><li>C.Stock Splits, Combinations and Dividends.</li><br>If the shares of Common Stock are subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or if a dividend is paid on the Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall be proportionately reduced in case of subdivision of shares or stock dividend or proportionately increased in the case of combination of shares, in

any security or debt instrument of the Borrower carrying the right to convert such security or debt instrument into Common Stock or of any warrant, right or option to purchase Common Stock shall result in an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Price upon the issuance of the above-described security, debt instrument, warrant, right, or option and again upon the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of su ch conversion or purchase rights if such issuance is at a price lower than the then applicable Fixed Conversion Price.<br>Common Stock issued or issuable by the Borrower for no consideration will be deemed issuable or to have been issued for $0.001 per share of Common Stock.<br>The reduction of the Fixed Conversion Price described in this paragraph is in addition to the other rights of the Holder described in the Subscription Agreement.<br><br><li>E.Funding Reset.</li><br>In the event on or before March 31, 2010, the Borrower does not raise an additional capital of not less than $500,000 of net proceeds to Borrower from the sale of common stock (Additional Funding), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced to $0.06, subject to adjustments as described in the

reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock not less than an amount of Common Stock equal to 150% of the amount of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the full conversion of this Note.</li><br>Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.<br>Borrower agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers, agents, and transfer agents who are charged with the duty of executing and issuing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of

shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amend ed, and Regulation 13d-3 thereunder.<br>Subject to the foregoing, the Holder shall not be limited
