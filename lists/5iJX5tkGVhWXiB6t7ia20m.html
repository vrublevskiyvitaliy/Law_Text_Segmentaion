assuming (i) a registration statement including such Conversion Shares for registration has been filed with the Commission, is effective and t he prospectus, as supplemented or amended, contained therein is current and (ii) Subscriber or its agent confirms in writing to the transfer agent that Subscriber has complied with the prospectus delivery requirements, the Company will reissue the

of the 1933 Act, provided that Subscriber delivers all reasonably requested representations in support of such opinion.<br><br><li>(b)Each Subscriber will give notice of its decision to exercise its

Conversion Shares issuable upon conversi on of the Note to Subscriber via express courier for receipt by Subscriber within five (5) business days after the Conversion Date (such fifth day being the

Company.<br><br></ul><li>7.2</li><br>[intentionally omitted]<br><li>7.3</li><br>Maximum Conversion.<br>A Subscriber shall not be entitled to convert on a Conversion Date that amount of a Note nor may the Company make any payment including principal, interest, or liquidated or other damages by delivery of Conversion Shares in connection with that number of Conversion Shares which would be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Subscriber and its Affiliates on a Conversion Date or payment date, and (ii) the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Note with respect to which the determination of this provision is being made on a calculation date, which would result in beneficial ownership by Subscriber and its Affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company on such Conversion Date.<br>For the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Se curities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 13d-3 thereunder.<br>Subject to the foregoing, the Subscriber shall not be limited to

described above and which shall be allocated to the excess above 4.99%.<br><br>8<br><li>7.4</li><br>Injunction Posting of Bond.<br>In the event a Subscriber shall elect to convert a Note or part thereof, the Company may not refuse conversion based on any claim that Subscriber or any one associated or affiliated with Subscriber has been engaged in any violation of law, or for any other reason, unless, a final non-appealable injunction from a court made on notice to Subscriber, restraining and or enjoining conversion of all or part of such Note shall have been sought and obtained by the Company and the Company has posted a surety bond for the benefit of Subscriber in the amount of 120% of the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest of the Note, or aggregate purchase price of the Conversion Shares which are sought to be subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to Subscri ber to the extent the judgment or decision is in Subscribers favor.<br><br><li>7.5</li><br>Buy-In.<br>In addition to any other rights available to Subscribers, if the Company fails to deliver to a Subscriber Conversion Shares by the Delivery Date and if after the Delivery Date Subscriber or a broker on Subscribers behalf purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by Subscriber of the Common Stock which Subscriber was entitled to receive upon such conversion (a "Buy-In"), then the Company shall pay to Subscriber (in addition to any remedies available to or elected by the Subscriber) the amount by which (A) Subscriber's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (B) the aggregate principal and/or interest amount of the Note for which such conversion request was not timely honored together with interest thereon at a rate of 15% per annum, accruing until such amount and any accru ed interest thereon is paid in full (which amount shall be paid as liquidated damages and not as a penalty).<br>For example, if a Subscriber purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of $10,000 of Note principal and/or interest, the Company shall be required to pay Subscriber $1,000 plus interest.<br>Subscriber shall provide the Company written notice and evidence indicating the amounts payable to Subscriber in respect of the Buy-In.<br><br><li>7.6Adjustments.</li><br>The Conversion Price, Warrant exercise price and amount of Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares shall be equitably adjusted and as otherwise described in

by Company in this Agreement or in any Exhibits or Schedules attached hereto in any Transaction Document, or other agreement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith, now or after the date hereof; or (ii) after any applicable notice and/or cure periods, any breach or default in performance by the Company of any covenant or undertaking to be performed by the Company hereunder, or any other agreement entered into by the Company and Subscribers relating hereto.</li><br><br><li>(b)In no event shall the liability of the Subscribers or permitted successor hereunder or under any Transaction Document or other agreement delivered in connection herewith be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds actually received by such Subscriber or successor upon the sale

10(a).<br><br></ul><li>11.Additional Post-Closing Obligations.</li><br><br><ul><li>11.1</li><br>Piggy-Back Registrations.<br>If at any time until two years after the Closing Date there is not an effective registration statement covering all of the Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement relating to an offering for its own account or the account of others under the 1933 Act of any of its equity securities, but excluding Forms S-4 or S-8 and similar forms which do not permit such registration, then the Company shall send to each holder of any of the Securities written notice of such determination and, if within fifteen calendar days after receipt of such notice, any such holder shall so request in writing, the Company shall include in such registration statement all or any part of the Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares such holder requests to be registered, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks applicable to all holders of registration rights and any cutbacks in accordance with guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (including, but not limited to, Rule 415).<br>The obligations of the Company under this Section may be waived by any holder of any of the Securities entitled to registration rights under this Section 11.1.<br>The holders whose Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares are included or required to be included in such registration statement are granted the same rights, benefits, liquidated or other damages and indemnification granted to other holders of securities included in such registration statement.<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the registration rights granted hereunder to the holders of Securities shall not be applicable for such times as such Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares may be sold by the holder thereof without restriction pursuant to Section 144(b)(1) of the 1933 Act.<br>In no event shall the liability of any holder of Securities or permitted successor in connection with any Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares included in any such registration statement be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds actually received by such Subscriber upon the sale of the Conversion Shares, Warrant Shares and Incentive Shares sold pursuant to such registration or such lesser amount in proportion to all other holders of Securities included in such registration statement.<br>All expenses incurred by the Company in complying with Section 11, including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing expenses (if required), fees and disbursements of counsel and independent public accountants for the Company, fees and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying with state securities or blue sky laws, fees of the NASD, transfer taxes, and fees of transfer agents and registrars, are called Registration Expenses.<br>All underwriting discounts and selling commissions applicable to the sale of registrable securities are called "Selling Expenses."<br>The Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration statement under Section 11.<br>Selling Expenses in connection with each registration statement under Section 11 shall be borne by the holder and will be apportioned among such holders in proportion to the number of Shares included therein for a holder relative to all the Securities included therein for all selling holders, or as all holders may agree<br><li>11.2</li><br>Delivery of Unlegended Shares.<br><br><ul><li>(a)Within three (3) business days (such third business day being the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date) after the business day on which the Company has received (i) a notice that Conversion Shares, or any other Common Stock held by Subscriber has been sold pursuant to a registration statement or Rule 144 under the 1933 Act, (ii) a representation that the prospectus delivery requirements, or the requirements of Rule 144, as applicable and if required, have been satisfied, (iii) the original share certificates representing the shares of Common Stock that have been sold, and (iv) in the case of sales under Rule 144, customary representation letters of the Subscriber and, if required, Subscribers broker regarding compliance with the requirements of Rule 144, the Company at its expense, (y) shall deliver, and shall cause legal counsel selected by the Company to deliver to its transfer agent (with copies to Subscriber) an appropriate instru ction and opinion of such counsel, directing the delivery of shares of Common Stock without any legends including the legend set forth in Section 4(h) above (the Unlegended Shares); and (z) cause the transmission of the certificates representing the Unlegended Shares together with a legended certificate representing the balance of the submitted Common Stock certificate, if any, to the Subscriber at the address specified in the notice of sale, via express courier, by electronic transfer or otherwise on or before the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date.</li><br><br><li>(b)In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Unlegended Shares, upon request of Subscriber, and, if the Company is DTC and/or DWAC eligible, so long as the certificates therefor do not bear a legend and the Subscriber is not obligated to return such certificate for the placement of a legend thereon, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Unlegended Shares by crediting the account of Subscribers prime broker with the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system, if such transfer agent participates in such DWAC system.</li><br>Such delivery must be made on or before the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date.<br><br>14<br><li>(c)The Company understands that a delay in the delivery of the Unlegended Shares pursuant to Section 11 hereof later than the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date could result in economic loss to a Subscriber.</li><br>As compensation to a Subscriber for such loss, the Company agrees to pay late payment fees (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) to the Subscriber for late delivery of Unlegended Shares in the amount of $100 per business day after the Delivery Date for each $10,000 of purchase price of the Unlegended Shares subject to the delivery default.<br>If during any 360 day period, the Company fails to deliver Unlegended Shares as required by this Section 11.2 for an aggregate of thirty days, then each Subscriber or assignee holding Securities subject to such default may, at its option, require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the Shares subject to such default at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) 120%, or (ii) a fraction in which the nume rator is the highest closing price of the Common Stock during the aforedescribed thirty day period and the denominator of which is the lowest conversion price during such thirty day period, multiplied by the price paid by Subscriber for such Common Stock (Unlegended Redemption Amount).<br>The Company shall pay any payments incurred under this Section in immediately available funds upon demand.<br><br><li>(d)In the event a Subscriber shall request delivery of Unlegended Shares as described in Section 11.</li>2 and the Company is required to deliver such Unlegended Shares pursuant to Section 11.2, the Company may not refuse to deliver Unlegended Shares based on any claim that such Subscriber or any one associated or affiliated with such Subscriber has been engaged in any violation of law, or for any other reason, unless, an injunction or temporary restraining order from a court, on notice, restraining and or enjoining delivery of such Unlegended Shares shall have been sought and obtained by the Company and the Company has posted a surety bond for the benefit of such Subscriber in the amount of 105% of the amount of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Stock which are subject to the injunction or temporary restraining order, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payab le to such Subscriber to the extent Subscriber obtains judgment in Subscribers favor.<br><br><li>(e)In addition to any other rights available to Subscriber, if the Company fails to deliver to a Subscriber Unlegended Shares as required pursuant to this Agreement and after the Unlegended Shares Delivery Date, the Subscriber or a broker on the Subscribers behalf, purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of common stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Subscriber of the shares of Common Stock which the Subscriber was entitled to receive from the Company (a "Buy-In"), then the Company shall pay in cash to the Subscriber (in addition to any remedies available to or elected by the Subscriber) the amount by which (A) the Subscriber's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of common stock so purchased exceeds (B) the aggregate purchase price of the shares of Common Stock delivered to the Company for reissuance as Unlegended Shares together with interest thereon at a rate of 15% per annum accruing until such amount and any accrued interest thereon is paid in full (which amount shall be paid as liquidated damages and not as a penalty).</li><br>For example, if a Subscriber purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to $10,000 of purchase price of shares of Common Stock delivered to the Company for reissuance as Unlegended Shares, the Company shall be required to pay the Subscriber $1,000, plus interest.<br>The Subscriber shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Subscriber in respect of the Buy-In.<br><br></ul><li>11.3</li><br>In the event commencing six months after the Closing Date and ending twenty-four months thereafter, the Subscriber is not permitted to resell any of the Conversion Shares without any restrictive legend or if such sales are permitted but subject to volume limitations or further restrictions on resale as a result of the unavailability to Subscriber of Rule 144(b)(1)(i) under the 1933 Act or any successor rule (a 144 Default), for any reason except for Subscribers status as an Affiliate or control person of the Company, or as a result of a change in current applicable securities laws, then the Company shall pay such Subscriber as liquidated damages and not as a penalty an amount equal to one percent (1%) for each thirty days (or such lesser pro-rata amount for any period less than thirty days) thereafter of the purchase price of the Conversion Shares subject to such 144 Default during the pendency of t he 144 Default.<br>Liquidated Damages shall not be payable pursuant to this Section 11.3 in connection with Shares for such times as such Shares may be sold by the holder thereof without restriction pursuant to Section 144(b)(1) of the 1933 Act or pursuant to an effective registration statement.<br><br></ul><li>12</li><ul><li>(a)</li>Right of First Refusal.<br>Subject to the rights of the Subscribers as set forth in the Prior Transactions [as defined in Section 13(m)], until the later of one year following the Closing Date or for so long as any amount remains outstanding on the Notes, the Subscribers shall be given not less than fifteen (15) business days prior written notice of any proposed sale by the Company of its common stock or other securities or equity linked debt obligations, except in connection with the Excepted Issuances [as defined in Section 12(b)].<br>If Subscribers elect to exercise their rights pursuant to this Section 12(a), Subscribers shall have the right during the fifteen (15) business days following receipt of the notice to purchase in the aggregate up to all of such offered common stock, debt or other securities in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the notice of sale relative to each other in proportion to the amount principal of the Notes to be issued to them on the Closing Date.<br>In the event such terms and conditions are modified during the notice period, Subscribers shall be given prompt notice of such modification and shall have the right during the fifteen (15) business days following the notice of modification to exercise such right.<br><br>15<br><li>(b)</li>Favored Nations

Common Stock issuable in connection therewith is issued at not less than $.09 per share of Common Stock, (ii) the Companys issuance of securities in connection with strategic license agreements and other partnering arrangements so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital and which holders of such securities or debt are not at any time granted registration rights equal to

Stock or the issuances or grants of options to purchase Common Stock to employees, directors, and consultants, pursuant to plans described on Schedule 5(d) as such plans are constituted on the Closing

this Agreement on the terms in effect on the Closing Date and described on Schedule 5(d), (v) as a result of the exercise of Warrants or conversion of Notes which are granted or issued pursuant to this Agreement, (vi) the Companys issuance of Common Stock or the issuances or grants of options to purchase Common Stock to consultants and service providers as set forth on Schedule 12(b), and (vii) an issuance of up to $43,000 of convertible promissory notes and warrants at a conversion price and warrant exercise pri ce of $0.10 to friends and family of the Company which promissory notes and warrants and supporting documents do not contain any registration rights, or reset provisions (collectively, the foregoing (i) through (vii) are Excepted Issuances), if at any time the Notes or Warrants are outstanding, the Company shall agree to or issue (the Lower Price Issuance) any Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock (or modify any of the foregoing which may be outstanding) to any person or entity at a price per share or conversion or exercise price per share which shall be less than the Conversion Price in effect at such time, or if less than the Warrant exercise price in effect at such time, without the consent of the Subscribers, then the Conversion Price and Warrant exercise price shall automatically be reduced to such other lower price.<br>The average Purchase Price of the Conversion Shares and average exercise price in relation to the Warrant Shares shall be calculated separately for the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares.<br>Common Stock issued or issuable by the Company for no consideration or for consideration that cannot be determined at the time of issue will be deemed issuable or to have been issued for $0.001 per share of Common Stock.<br>For purposes of the issuance and adjustments described in this paragraph, the issuance of any security of the Company carrying the right to convert such security into shares of Common Stock or any warrant, right or option to purchase Common Stock shall result in the issuance of the additional shares of Common Stock upon the sooner of the agreement to or actual issuance of such convertible security, warrant, right or options and again at any time upon any subsequent issuances of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of such conversion or purchase rights if such issuance is at a price lower than the Conversion Price or warrant exercise price in effect upon such issuance.<br>The rights of Subscribers set forth in this Section 12 are in addition to any other rights the Subscribers have pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes, any Transaction Document, and any other agreement referred to or entered into in connection herewith or to which Subscribers and Company are parties.<br><br><li>(c)</li>Maximum Exercise of Rights.<br>In the event the exercise of the rights described in Section 12(a) and Section 12(b) would or could result in the issuance of

of such additional shares of Common Stock of the Company to Subscribers will be deferred in whole or in part until such time as Subscribers are able to beneficially own such Common Stock without
