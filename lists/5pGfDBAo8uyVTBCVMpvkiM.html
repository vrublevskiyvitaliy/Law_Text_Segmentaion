Exchange Offer, or (B) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus (other than by reason of such Holders

losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions and expenses (including, without limitation, and as incurred, reimbursement of all reasonable costs of investigating, preparing, pursuing, settling, compromising, paying or defending any claim or action, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to any Indemnified Holder), joint or several, directly or indirectly caused by, related to, based upon, arising out of or in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or Free Writing Prospectus, in all cases including any documents incorporated by reference therein, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any

statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by any of the Holders expressly for use therein</li>This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company or any of the Note Guarantors may otherwise have.<br><br>15<br>In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company or the Note Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company and the Note Guarantors in writing; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any of the Company or the Note Guarantors of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.<br>Such Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid, as incurred, by the Company and the Note Guarantors (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified Holder is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).<br>The Company and the Note Guarantors shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the

admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Holder.<br><br><li>(b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to

or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that no such Holder shall be liable for any claims hereunder in excess of the amount of net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to any such Registration Statement</li>In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Note Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers or the other Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities or their respective directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a<br>16<br>Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the

reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Holders and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations</li>The relative fault of the Company and the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Holders and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any of the Note Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.<br><br>The Company, the Note Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.<br>The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.<br><br>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Initial Purchaser (or its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the New Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.<br>No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of New Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.<br><br>17<br></ul><li>SECTION 9.Participation in Underwritten Registrations.</li><br><li>SECTION 10.Selection of Underwriters.</li>In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker(s)
