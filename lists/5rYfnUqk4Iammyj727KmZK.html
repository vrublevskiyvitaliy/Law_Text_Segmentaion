Company's right to repurchase at its Exercise Price.<br>Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless Section 280G Approval, as defined in the Plan, has been obtained, no acceleration of vesting or payment shall occur under this Agreement to the extent that such acceleration or payment would, after<br>4<br>taking into account any other payments in the nature of compensation to which the Optionee would have a right to receive from the Company and any other Person contingent upon the occurrence of such Change in Control, result in a "parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.<br><br><li>22.Entire Agreement</li>The Notice of Stock Option Grant, this Agreement, and the Plan constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter hereof.<br>They supersede any other agreements, representations or understandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied) which relate to the subject
