behalf of any Placement Agent consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.</li><br><li>(b) Each Placement Agent agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Placement Agent, but only with reference to information relating to such Placement Agent furnished to the Company in writing by such Placement Agent through you expressly for use in the Time of Sale Memorandum or either Memorandum or any amendments or supplements thereto.</li>The Company acknowledges that (i) the last full paragraph of the cover page of each Memorandum, (ii) the third sentence of the second full paragraph under the caption Private Placement in each Memorandum, (iii) the first sentence of the seventh full paragraph under the caption Private Placement in each Memorandum, (iii) the eighth full paragraph under the caption Private Placement in each Memorandum and (iv) the eleventh full paragraph under

Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the indemnified party) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the indemnifying party) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified</li>21<br>party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.<br>In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, (iii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iv) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party.<br>It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.<br>Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).<br>The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.<br>No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any

statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.<br><br><li>(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b)

lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Placement Agents on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.<br>The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total discounts and commissions (after deducting reimbursements for expenses incurred by the Company) received by the Placement Agents, in each case as set forth in the Time of Sale Memorandum and the Final Memorandum, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities.<br>The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Placement Agents on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Placement Agents and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.<br>The Placement Agents respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportions to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.<br><br><li>(e) The Company and the Placement Agents agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Placement Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).</li>The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.<br>Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Placement Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the discount and commissions received by it in connection with the Securities distributed by it.<br>No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>The remedies provided for in this<br>23<br>Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies, which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.<br><br><li>(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Placement Agent, any person controlling any Placement Agent or any affiliate of any Placement Agent or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.</li><br></ul><li>9.Termination</li>The Placement Agents may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior

to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Placement Agents shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such</li>24<br>non-defaulting Placement Agents, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Placement Agent or Placement Agents agreed but failed

Placement Agents shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Placement Agent or of the Company.<br>In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Time of Sale Memorandum or the Final Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.<br>Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Placement Agent from liability in respect of any default of such Placement Agent under this Agreement.<br><br><li>(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Placement Agents, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Placement Agents or such Placement Agents as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and
