following receipt of the Second Notice (the Preferred Shareholders Option Period) to elect to purchase all or any portion of its respective pro rata share of the Offered Shares set out in the Second Notice at the same price and subject to the same material terms and conditions as described in the Transfer Notice, by notifying the Transferor and the Company in writing before expiration of the Preferred Shareholders Option Period as to the number of such Offered Shares that it wishes to purchase.</li><br><li>(b) For the purposes of this Section 7.2(iii), each such Preferred Shareholders pro rata share of the Offered Shares shall be equal to (A) the total number of Offered Shares which the Company has not elected to purchase pursuant to Section 7.2(ii), multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the aggregate number of Conversion Shares held by such Preferred Shareholder on the date of the Transfer Notice and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Conversion Shares held by all Preferred Shareholders on such date.</li><br><li>(c) If any such Preferred Shareholder fails to exercise its right to purchase its full pro rata share of the available Offered Shares, the Transferor shall deliver written notice (the Third Notice) within five (5) days after the expiration of the Preferred Shareholders Option Period to the Company and each Preferred Shareholder that elected to purchase its entire pro rata share of the Offered Shares (an Exercising Shareholder of Right of First Refusal).</li>The Exercising Shareholders of Right of First Refusal shall have a right of re-allotment, and may exercise an additional right to purchase such unpurchased Offered Shares by notifying the<br>-15-<br>Transferor and the Company in writing within ten (10) days after receipt of the Third Notice; provided, however, that if the Exercising Shareholders of Right of First Refusal desire to purchase in aggregate more than the number of such unpurchased Offered Shares, then such unpurchased Offered Shares will be allocated to the extent necessary among the Exercising Shareholders of Right of First Refusal in accordance with their relative pro rata shares based on the number of the unpurchased Offered Shares such Exercising Shareholders of Right of First Refusal have elected to purchase pursuant to this Section 7.2(iii)(c).<br><br><li>(d) Subject to applicable securities Laws, each such Preferred Shareholder shall be entitled to apportion Offered Shares to be purchased among its Affiliates, provided that such Preferred Shareholder

delivery of such Offered Shares to be purchased, at a place agreed to by the Transferor, the Company and all the participating Preferred Shareholders and at the time of the scheduled closing therefor, no later than sixty (60) days after the Companys receipt of the Transfer Notice, unless such notice contemplated a later closing with the Third Party Purchaser or unless the value of the purchase price has not yet been established pursuant to Section 7.2(v).<br>The Transferor shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any Transfer Notice and any intent to transfer Offered Shares at any time, whether or not the Company and/or any Preferred Shareholder has elected to purchase under this Section 7.2 any Offered Shares offered thereby.<br><br><li>(v) Valuation of

shall have the right to pay the purchase price in the form of cash equal in amount to the fair market value of such property.</li><br><li>(b) If the Transferor, the Company and the Preferred Shareholders cannot agree on such cash value within the Preferred Shareholders Option Period, the valuation shall be made by an appraiser of internationally recognized standing jointly selected by the Transferor, the Company (if the Company has elected to purchase any Offered Shares) and the Preferred Shareholders that have elected to purchase a majority of the Offered Shares elected to be purchased by the Preferred Shareholders (if any Preferred Shareholders have elected to purchase any Offered Shares) or, if they cannot agree on an appraiser within the Companys Option Period (or the Preferred Shareholders Option Period if the Company does not elect to purchase all Offered Shares), each shall select an appraiser of internationally recognized standing and the two appraisers shall designate a third appraiser of internationally recognized standing, whose appraisal shall be determinative of such value.</li><br><li>(c) The cost of such appraisal shall be shared equally by the Transferor, on the one hand, and the Company and the participating Preferred Shareholders, on the other hand, with the portion of the cost borne by the Company and the Preferred Shareholders to be

the value of the purchase price in the Transfer Notice is not determined within the sixty (60) day period specified in Section 7.2(iv) above, the closing of the purchase of Offered Shares by the

Right of Co-Sale.</li><br><ul><li>(i) To the extent the Company and the Preferred Shareholders do not exercise their respective rights of first refusal as to all of the Equity Securities of the

Shares shall have the right to participate in such sale of Equity Securities on the same terms and conditions as specified in the Transfer Notice (but in no event less favorable to the Transferor) by notifying the Transferor in writing within ten (10) days after the expiration of the last applicable notice period set forth in Section 7.2(iii) (such Preferred Shareholder a Selling Shareholder).</li>Such Selling Shareholders notice to the Transferor shall indicate the number of Equity Securities the Selling Shareholder wishes to sell under its right to participate.<br>To the extent one or more Preferred Shareholders exercise such right of participation in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below, the number of Equity Securities of the Company that the Transferor may sell in the Transfer shall be correspondingly reduced proportionally.<br><br><li>(ii) The total number of Equity Securities of the Company that each Selling Shareholder may elect to sell shall be equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of the Offered Shares being transferred following the exercise or expiration of all rights of first refusal pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Ordinary Shares (assuming the exercise, conversion and exchange of any Ordinary Shares Equivalents) owned by such Selling Shareholder on the date of the Transfer Notice and the denominator of which is the total number of Ordinary Shares (assuming the exercise, conversion and exchange of any Ordinary Shares Equivalents) owned by the Transferor and all Selling Shareholders on the date of the Transfer Notice.</li><br><li>(iii) Each Selling Shareholder shall effect its participation in the sale by promptly delivering to the Transferor for transfer to the Third Party Purchaser one or more certificates, properly endorsed for transfer, which represent the type and number of Equity Securities of the Company which such Selling Shareholder elects to sell; provided, however that if the Third Party Purchaser objects to the delivery of Equity Securities in lieu of Ordinary Shares, such Selling Shareholder shall only deliver Ordinary Shares (and therefore shall convert any such Equity Securities into Ordinary Shares) and certificates corresponding to such Ordinary Shares.</li>The Company agrees to make any such conversion concurrent with the actual transfer of such shares to the purchaser and contingent on such transfer.<br><br><li>(iv) The share certificate or certificates that a Selling Shareholder delivers to the Transferor pursuant to this Section 6.3(iv) shall be transferred to the Third Party Purchaser in consummation of the sale of the Equity Securities pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Transfer Notice, and the Transferor shall concurrently therewith remit to such Selling Shareholder that portion of the sale proceeds to which such Selling Shareholder is entitled by reason of its participation in such sale.</li><br><li>(v) To the extent that any Third Party Purchaser prohibits the participation of a Selling Shareholder exercising its co-sale rights hereunder in a proposed Transfer or otherwise refuses to purchase shares or other securities from a Selling Shareholder exercising its</li>-17-<br>co-sale rights hereunder, the Transferor shall not sell to such Third Party Purchaser any Equity Securities unless and until, simultaneously with such sale, the Transferor shall purchase from such Selling Shareholder such shares or other securities that such Selling Shareholder would otherwise be entitled to sell to the Third Party Purchaser pursuant to its co-sale rights for the same consideration and on the same terms and conditions as the proposed transfer described in the Transfer Notice.<br><br></ul><li>7.4 Non-Exercise of Rights.</li><br><ul><li>(i) To the extent that the Company and the Preferred Shareholders have not exercised their rights to purchase all Offered Shares within the time periods specified in Section 7.2, subject to the right of the Preferred Shareholders to exercise their rights to participate in the sale of Offered

remaining Offered Shares to the Third Party Purchaser identified in the Transfer Notice upon terms and conditions (including the purchase price) no more favorable to the purchaser than those specified

consummation of any sale, shall execute and deliver to the Parties documents and other instruments assuming the obligations of such Transferor under this Agreement with respect to the Offered Shares,

not consummate the sale or disposition of any Offered Shares within sixty (60) days from the expiration of such rights, rights of the Shareholders under Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, as the case may be, shall be re-invoked and shall be applicable to any subsequent disposition of such Offered Shares by the Transferor until such rights lapse in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</li><br><li>(iii) The exercise or non-exercise of the rights of the Shareholders under this Section 7.4 to purchase Equity Securities of the Company from a Transferor or participate in the
