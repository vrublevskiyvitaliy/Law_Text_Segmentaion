the Indemnified Party, in the Legal Action will, in the good faith opinion of Buyer, establish a custom or precedent which will be adverse to the best interests of the continuing business of the Hotel, the Indemnifying Party, shall not be entitled to assume the defense of the Legal Action and the defense shall be handled by the Indemnified Party.<br>If the defense of the Legal Action is
