specifications shall be deemed to be the Specifications hereunder, provided that Think shall be solely responsible for the development costs of such modified Units, and such amendments shall take into account any new or additional development and production costs that EnerDel would incur in connection with designing and supplying such modified Units to the Think Entities.<br><br><li>2.6.2 As of the date hereof, the Parties intend to develop a version of the lithium-ion battery using lower kWh (in the range of 20-22 kWh, although the exact energy content will be confirmed by Think and EnerDel after the date hereof) to improve Think sales, and the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith the pricing for such lithium-ion batteries</li>Solely for purposes of reference, as of the date hereof, EnerDel estimates that the price for one 21kWh lithium-ion battery would be [***], provided that such pricing would be effective from the SOP of such version of lithium-ion battery until the later of (i) the date on which 3000 of such batteries have been sold by EnerDel hereunder and (ii) June 30, 2011.<br>After such later date, Think shall have set market benchmarking for the pricing of such battery, provided that such benchmarking shall be consistent with the pricing of not less than three established and recognized lithium-ion suppliers (and the price quotes of such alternative suppliers must be in writing), and shall further include a supply period of not less than 24 months.<br>If EnerDel does not offer Think competitive pricing on such batteries in accordance with this Section 2.6.2, and as a result, Think desires to use an alternative supplier before it has satisfied the minimum purchase requirements of Section 2.3, then prior to entering into a supply agreement with such alternate supplier, Think shall cause such alternate supplier to purchase all of Ener1s equity interest in Think at a price that is the greater of (i) the liquidation preference of such equity interest and (ii) the fair market value of such equity interest.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, EnerDel will, at all times prior to being bought out by an alternate supplier, have the right to match the pricing of any of such competitor, in which case, Think shall purchase such batteries from EnerDel.<br><br><li>2.6.3 During the engineering development, pre-production and ramp up periods for the launch of the EnerDel lithium-ion batteries, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to jointly establish appropriate milestones which will be reviewed periodically in order to assure that any production or other problems or issues are identified and addressed as promptly as practicable</li><br><li>2.6.4 The Parties shall work exclusively with each other and cooperate in good faith to create a supplemental cooling system for the lithium-ion batteries required for high ambient temperature markets, and will share in the development costs associated with such cooling system in manner that is economically consistent with the terms of this Agreement</li><br></ul><li>2.7 Timeliness of Delivery</li>Unless otherwise agreed, delivery times shall be as set forth in the applicable Order.<br>EnerDel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the agreed upon time of delivery for each Order.<br>In the event that EnerDel has reason to believe that a delivery will be delayed,

changes to the date or place of delivery of any Units, the Parties will negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the price and, if applicable, the delivery schedules.<br>EnerDel shall be responsible for any demonstrable loss incurred by Think to the extent directly caused by EnerDels delay (and such delay is not caused by Force Majeure, Think or the carrier), provided that such recourse against EnerDel shall not exceed the purchase price of the Units subject to such delayed shipment.<br>If there has been a delay caused by EnerDel (and such delay is not caused by Force Majeure, Think or the carrier), Think may request shipment of the Units subject to such delay by a more expeditious and commercially reasonable method of transportation, and EnerDel shall cover the extra costs of such transportation.<br><br><li>2.8 Packing and Marking</li>EnerDel shall pack and mark the Units in accordance with its applicable packaging standards unless specific instructions have been previously
