in any direction, waiver or consent, the Securities of any Series owned by the Company or any other obligor on such Securities, or by any Affiliate of any of them, shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities of such Series which the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.<br>Securities of such Series so owned which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgees right so to act with respect to the Securities of such Series and that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of such Series, or an Affiliate of any of

satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.12.<br>No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section 2.12, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.<br><br><li>PAYMENT OF INTEREST</li><br>Except as

Default;<br>(4) the Company or any Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:<br><ul><li>(A) commences a voluntary case,</li><li>(B) consents to the entry of an

outstanding by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare that the entire principal amount of all the Securities of that Series then outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of acceleration are immediately due and payable, in which case such amounts shall become immediately due and payable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after such acceleration but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration is obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of that Series may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, interest or premium, if any, that has become due solely because of the

Securities of that Series or this Indenture.<br><br>23<br>The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of that Series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.<br>A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.<br>No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy.<br>All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.<br><br><li>WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT</li><br>Subject to Sections 6.2, 6.7 and 8.2, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any Series then outstanding have the right to waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to such Series or compliance with any provision of this Indenture (with respect to such Series) or the Securities of such Series.<br>Upon any such waiver, such Default with respect to such Series shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default with respect to such Series arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.<br>This Section 6.4 shall be in lieu of TIA Section 316(a)(1)(B), and TIA

action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.<br>This Section 6.5 shall be in lieu of TIA Section 316(a)(1)(A), and TIA Section 316(a)(1)(A) is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture and Section as permitted by the TIA.<br><br><li>LIMITATION ON SUITS</li><br>Subject to Section 6.7, a Securityholder may not institute any proceeding or pursue any remedy

INDENTURE ACT</li><br>Every amendment to, or supplement of, this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.<br><br><li>REVOCATION AND EFFECT OF CONSENTS</li><br>Until an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent conclusive and binding upon such Holder and every subsequent Holder of the same Security or portion thereof, and of any Security issued upon the transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in place thereof, even if notation of the consent is not made on any such Security.<br>Any such Holder or subsequent Holder, however, may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security, if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective.<br><br>The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver, which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent.<br>If a record date is fixed, then, notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment, supplement or waiver, or to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.<br><br>34<br>After an amendment, supplement, waiver or other action becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (1) through (9) of Section 8.2.<br>In that case, the amendment, supplement, waiver or other action shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holders Security; PROVIDED, that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to receive payment of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder.<br><br><li>NOTATION ON OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES</li><br>If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security of any Series, the Trustee may request the Holder of such Security to deliver it to the Trustee.<br>In such case, the Trustee shall place an appropriate notation on such Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder.<br>Alternatively, the Company, in exchange for such Security, may issue, and the Trustee shall authenticate, a new security that reflects the changed terms.<br>Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Security shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.<br><br><li>TRUSTEE TO SIGN AMENDMENTS</li><br>The Trustee shall sign any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 8 if the amendment, supplement or waiver does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.<br>If it does, the Trustee may, but need not, sign it.<br>In signing or refusing to sign such amendment, supplement or waiver the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and, subject to Section 7.1, shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment, supplement or waiver is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.<br>The Company may not sign an amendment or supplement until the Board of Directors of the Company approves it.<br><br>ARTICLE 9<br>DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE; DEFEASANCE<br><ul><li>DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE</li><br>The Company may terminate its obligations under the Securities of any Series and this
