retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.</li>The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5.7, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 5.7.<br><br><li>(d)	If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.7 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense referred to therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.</li>The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.<br><br><li>(e)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with an underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall control.</li><br><li>(f)	The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 5.7 shall survive the completion of the Offering.</li><br></ul><li>5.8	Permitted Transferees.</li>The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities granted to the Holders by the Company under this Article 5 may be assigned in full by a Holder in connection with a transfer by such Holder of its Registrable Securities, to (a) any partner or retired partner of a Holder that is a partnership, or (b) any family member or trust for the benefit of any individual Holder, provided that (i) such Holder gives prior written notice to the Company; (ii) such transferee agrees to comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement; (iii) such transfer is otherwise in compliance with this Agreement; and (iv) such transfer is otherwise effected in accordance with applicable securities laws.<br>Except as specifically permitted by this Section 5.8, the rights of a Holder with respect to Registrable Securities as set out herein shall not be transferable to any other person, and any attempted transfer shall cause all rights of such Holder therein to be forfeited.<br><br></ul><li>MISCELLANEOUS</li><ul><li>6.1	Any notice or other communication given hereunder shall be deemed sufficient if in writing and sent by
