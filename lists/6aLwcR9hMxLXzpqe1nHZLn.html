Buy-In Adjustment Amount is the amount equal to the excess, if any, of (x) such Investors total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Covering Shares over (y) the net proceeds (after brokerage commissions, if any) received by such Investor from the sale of the Sold Shares.<br>The Company shall pay the Buy-In Adjustment Amount to such Investor in immediately
