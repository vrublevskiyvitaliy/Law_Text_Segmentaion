estate, either alone or jointly with any other person, whether a Member or not, but the Directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this

dividends or other monies payable in respect thereof.<br><br><li>26.The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any shares on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be

amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the share, or the persons entitled thereto by reason of his death or

person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.</li><br><br>CALLS ON SHARES<br><li>29.Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may from time to time make calls upon the Members in respect of any money unpaid on their shares, and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 calendar days notice specifying the time or times of payment) pay to the Company at the time or

thereof to the time of the actual payment, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of that interest wholly or in part.</li><br><br><li>32.The provisions of these Articles as to the liability of joint holders and as to payment of interest shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</li><br><br><li>33.The Directors may make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the Members, or the particular shares, in the amount of calls to be paid and in the times of payment.</li><br><br><li>34.The Directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced may (until the same would, but for such advance, become presently payable) pay interest at such rate (not exceeding without the sanction of an Ordinary Resolution, eight percent.</li><br>per annum) as may be agreed upon between the Member paying the sum in advance and the Directors.<br>No such sum paid in advance of calls shall entitle the member paying such sum to any portion of a dividend declared in respect of any period prior to the date upon which such sum would, but for such payment, become presently payable.<br><br>FORFEITURE OF SHARES<br><li>35.If a Member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the Directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of such call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of such much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.</li><br><br><li>36.The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 calendar days from the date of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.</li><br><br><li>37.If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any share in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors to that effect.</li><br><br><li>38.A</li>forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit , and at any time before a sale or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit .<br><br><li>39.A</li>person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the forfeited shares , but shall , notwithstanding , remain liable to pay to the Company all moneys which at the date of forfeiture were payable by him to the Company in respect of the shares , but his liability shall cease if and when the Company receives payment in full of the fully paid up amount of the shares .<br><br>11<br><li>40.A</li>certificate in writing under the hand of a Director of the Company , and that a share has been forfeited on a date stated in the certificate , shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share .<br>The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share or any sale or disposition thereof and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.<br><br><li>41.The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes due and payable, whether on account of the amount of the share, or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.</li><br><br>REGISTRATION OF EMPOWERING INSTRUMENTS<br><li>42.The Company shall be entitled to charge a fee not exceeding one dollar (US$1.</li>00) on the registration of every probate,

more holders, the survivors or survivor, or the legal personal representatives of the deceased survivor, shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to the share.<br><br><li>44.Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member shall upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be properly required by the Directors, have the right either to be registered as a member in respect of the share or, instead of being registered himself, to make such transfer of the share as the deceased or bankrupt person could have made.</li><br>If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered himself as holder he shall deliver or send to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects.<br><br><li>45.A</li>person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share , except that he shall not , before being registered as a Member in respect of the share , be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company , provided however , that the Directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or
