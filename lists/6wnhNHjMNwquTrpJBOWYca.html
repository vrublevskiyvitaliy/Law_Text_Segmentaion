to, if any, by 11 a.m., New York City time, on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date.<br>Failure of the Partnership to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Debt Securities specified in this paragraph) shall not constitute a Default, but such failure shall require that the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Debt Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in this Section 3.05 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.<br><br>Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in

Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities shall be applied by the Trustee, together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of that series at its Stated Maturity.<br><br>The Trustee shall select the Debt Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in the last paragraph of Section 3.02 and the Partnership shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 3.02 except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Debt Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund.<br>Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.<br><br>The Trustee shall not redeem any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of such Debt Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Debt Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Debt Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Debt Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee shall redeem such Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article III.<br>Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Debt Securities; provided, however, that in

different or additional offices or agencies to be maintained for such purposes (in or outside of such Place of Payment), and may from time to time rescind any such designation; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Partnership of its obligations described in the preceding paragraph.<br>The Partnership will give prompt written notice to the Trustee

other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid, shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.<br><br>29<br></ul><ul><li>Section 6.06  Rights of Holders

Indenture, and that subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel shall determine that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken or is inconsistent with any provision of this Indenture, or if the Trustee shall by a responsible officer or officers determine that the action so directed would involve it in personal liability or would be unduly prejudicial to Holders of Debt Securities of such series not taking part in such direction; and provided, further, however, that nothing in this Indenture contained shall impair the right of the Trustee to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction by such Holders.<br>The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Debt Securities of that series waive any past Default or Event of Default and its consequences for that series, except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Debt Securities and a Default or Event of Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected thereby.<br>In case of any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture, and the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Partnership, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities of that series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 6.07  Trustee to Give Notice of Events of Defaults Known to It, but May Withhold Such Notice in Certain
