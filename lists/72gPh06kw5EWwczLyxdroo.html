including, in the case of an outstanding Option or SAR, a cash payment to the holder of such Option or SAR in consideration for the cancellation of such Option or SAR in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value (as of a date specified by the Administrator) of the Shares subject to such Option or SAR over the aggregate exercise price of such Option or SAR (it being understood that, in such event, any Option or SAR having a per Share exercise price equal to, or in excess of, the Fair Market Value of a Share subject to such Option or SAR may be cancelled and terminated without any payment or consideration therefore).</li><br>Such adjustments made by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive.<br>Any Shares issuable as a result of any such adjustment shall be rounded to the next lower whole Share; no fractional Shares shall be issued.<br>At all times the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company.<br><br>8<br></ul><li>4.4Substitute Awards.</li>The number of Shares underlying any Substitute Awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan; provided, however, that Substitute Awards issued in connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an entity that is acquired by the Corporation or its Affiliate through a merger or acquisition shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan; provided further, however, that Substitute Awards issued in connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding stock options intended to qualify for special tax treatment under Code  421 and 422 that were previously granted by an entity that is acquired by the Corporation or an Affiliate through a merger or acquisition shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Incentive Stock Options under the Plan.<br><br>ARTICLE 5<br>PARTICIPATION<br><ul><li>5.1Eligibility.</li>However, Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.<br><br><li>5.2Termination of Participation.</li>Thereafter, the Participant shall have no rights with respect to any Awards under the Plan.<br><br><ul><li>(a)Defining Cause.</li><br>ARTICLE 6<br>STOCK OPTIONS<br><ul><li>6.1Option Grant.</li>However, no Participant shall be granted more than 50,000 Options in any calendar year.<br>In the case of Incentive Stock Options, the terms and conditions of such grants shall be subject to and comply with such rules as may be prescribed by Code  422 and any regulations related thereto, as may be amended from time to time.<br>All Options granted under the Plan shall be Non-Qualified Stock Options unless the applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option.<br>If an Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option, and if for any reason such Option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent of such non-qualification, such Option (or portion thereof) shall be regarded as a Non-Qualified Stock Option appropriately granted under the Plan, provided that such Option (or portion thereof) otherwise complies with the Plans requirements relating to Non-Qualified Stock Options.<br><br>9<br><ul><li>(a)Term of Option.</li>In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be 10 years from the date of grant or such

of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.<br><br><li>(b)$100,000 Limitation for Incentive Stock Options.</li>However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Corporation and any Affiliate) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options.<br>For purposes of this Section 6.1(b), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted.<br>The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.<br><br></ul><li>6.2Exercise Price.</li>Options are intended to qualify as qualified performance-based compensation under Code  162(m).<br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with an exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Code  424(a) (involving a corporate reorganization).<br><br><li>6.3Waiting Period and Exercise Dates.</li><br><li>6.4Exercise of Option</li><br><ul><li>(a)Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a

remain exercisable for 12 months following Participants death.<br><br>11<br><li>(e)Buyout Provisions.</li><br><li>(f)Reversion to Plan.</li>If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified

provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award, to the extent applicable, until 10 days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable.<br>In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Corporation repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall

such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable.<br>Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded

notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be exercisable for a period of up to 15 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.<br>For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Affiliate, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Affiliate equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.<br>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Corporation or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participants consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.<br><br>16<br><li>(b)Restricted Stock, Unrestricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units, and Other Stock Based Awards.</li>With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the Change in Control the Participants status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested.<br>Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Unrestricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Unrestricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested.<br>For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Unrestricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if following the Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Affiliate, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Affiliate equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.<br>Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Corporation or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participants consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporations post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.<br><br>17<br>ARTICLE 14<br>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS<br><ul><li>14.1No Uniform Rights to Awards.</li>The terms and conditions of Awards and the
