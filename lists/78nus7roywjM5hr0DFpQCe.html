tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes

federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.<br>Any good faith determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Company and Executive.<br>As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by Company should have been made (Underpayment), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.<br>In the event that Company exhausts its

Section 6.3, Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner; and Executive agrees to prosecute such contest<br>13<br>to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as Company shall determine; provided further, however, that if Company directs Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, Company shall advance the amount of such payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of Executive with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.<br>Furthermore, Companys control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.<br><br></ul><li>6.4 If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by Company pursuant to Section 6.</li>If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by Company pursuant to said Section 6.3, a determination is made that Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and Company does not notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid; and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.<br><br><li>6.5 Subject to any earlier time limits set forth in this Section 6, all payments and reimbursements to which Executive is entitled under this Section 6 shall be paid to or on behalf of Executive not later than the end of the taxable year of Executive next following

Expenses.</li><br><br>Company agrees to pay promptly as incurred and not less than on a monthly basis, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest by Company, Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of the Agreement (including as a result of any contest initiated by Executive about the amount of any payment due pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code; provided, however, that Company shall not be obligated to make such payment with respect to any contest in which Company prevails over Executive, and, in such case, Executive shall return to Company any payments previously paid to or on behalf of Executive.<br><br><li>9.Indemnification.</li><br><br>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Company shall indemnify
