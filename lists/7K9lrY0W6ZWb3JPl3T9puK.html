The proceeds from the sale of the Shares will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes</li><br>NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Investors hereby agree as follows:<br>ARTICLE I<br>THE SHARES<br></ul><ul><li>1.1	Purchase and Sale of Shares; Closing</li><br><ul><li>(a) Subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof, the Company hereby agrees to issue and sell to each of the Investors, and each of the Investors hereby confirms its irrevocable subscription for and offer to purchase, the number of the Shares equal to the Subscription Amount, divided by the applicable Purchase Price</li>The obligation of the Investors to purchase the Shares are several and not joint.<br>The aggregate number of the Shares issued hereunder shall not exceed 14,285,714 (the Maximum Share Amount).<br><br><li>(b)	The Company may conduct up to two closings (each, a Closing) to effect the issuance of the Shares</li>The initial Closing (the Initial Closing) shall take place on the date hereof.<br>If an additional Closing is required because the Company determines to seek Stockholder Approval (as defined below), then the Company shall conduct such additional Closing (the Additional Closing) on or about the third business day after Stockholder Approval is obtained or on such other date after Stockholder Approval is obtained as the Company and Marchant Securities Inc.<br>(the Canadian Placement Agent), the placement agent for the Investors resident in Canada, may agree.<br><br><li>(c)	Prior to each Closing, each Investor (provided that such Investor is participating in such Closing) shall deliver its Subscription Amount into the trust account of the Companys counsel, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.</li><br><li>(d)	The per share purchase price of Shares, with respect to which an Investor has delivered its Subscription Amount prior to the Initial Closing Date, shall equal 80% of the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market for the ten-trading day period immediately preceding the Initial Closing Date (the Initial Closing Purchase Price)</li>The per share purchase price of Shares, with respect to which an Investor will have delivered its Subscription Amount following the Initial Closing Date but prior to the Additional Closing Date, shall equal 80% of the volume weighted average price of

limit on the number of the Shares that the Company may issue without first obtaining Stockholder Approval (such number of Shares, the Initial Closing Maximum)</li>At the Initial Closing, the Company shall issue the Shares subscribed for by Investors which have submitted their Subscription Amount prior to the Initial Closing; provided, however that, if the aggregate number of such Shares would exceed the Initial Closing Maximum, then the number of Shares issued to each Investor at the Initial Closing shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, such that the aggregate number of the Shares actually issued at the Initial Closing (the Initial Closing Shares) equals the Initial Closing Maximum.<br>In that event, only an amount equal to the product of (i) the Initial Closing Purchase Price and (ii) the number of the Initial Closing Shares shall be released to the Company from the Trust Account.<br>The balance of the aggregate Subscription Amount shall remain in the Trust Account, and Shares subscribed for by the Investors in excess of the Initial Closing Maximum (the Remaining Shares) shall remain unissued; provided, however, that each of the Investors promptly shall be refunded its portion of the balance of the aggregate Subscription Amount remaining in the Trust Account (A) if, within ten days of the Initial Closing, the Company fails to initiate efforts to obtain Stockholder Approval or (B) if Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the first meeting of the Companys stockholders called for that purpose.<br>Such refund, if any, will be made within three business days of the determination that such refund is required to be made pursuant to this Section 1.1(e).<br>At the Additional Closing, if any, the Remaining Shares shall be issued to the Investors and the balance of the aggregate Subscription Amount remaining in the Trust Account immediately following the Initial Closing shall be released to the Company.<br>For greater certainty, the Initial Closing Maximum shall take into account, and include, the number of shares of the Common Stock that will be required to be issued to the Canadian Placement Agent at the Initial Closing pursuant to the Agency Agreement (as defined below).<br><br>- 2 - -<br><li>(f)	If the sum of (i) the number of the Initial Closing Shares and (ii) the number of the Remaining Shares is less than the Maximum Share Amount, then the Company may offer for sale (but shall not be obligated to do so), at the Additional Closing Purchase Price, additional Shares in a number not to exceed the difference between the Maximum Share Amount and such sum (the Additional Shares)</li>At or prior to the Additional Closing, if any, subscribers for the Additional Shares shall execute and deliver this Agreement as of the date hereof and shall be an Investor hereunder, with all of the rights and obligations of an Investor hereunder.<br>For greater certainty, in accordance with Section 1.1(c), prior to the Additional Closing, subscribers for the Additional Shares shall deliver the Subscription Amount for the Additional Shares into the Trust Account.<br>At the Additional Closing, the Additional Shares shall be issued and the aggregate Subscription Amount for the Additional Shares shall be released to the Company from the Trust Account.<br><br><li>(g)	The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Stockholder Approval as soon as practicable after the Initial Closing</li>However, if the Companys board of directors or duly appointed committee thereof (the Board), in good faith, determines that it shall not be commercially reasonable to do so (including by reason of the anticipated costs of doing so exceeding the anticipated proceeds of sale of the Remaining Shares and the Additional Shares), then the Company shall not be required to seek Stockholder Approval and the aggregate Subscription Amount then being held in the Trust Account shall be returned to the Investors promptly and, in any event, within three business days.<br><br><li>(h)	In the event that any of the Subscription Amount is refunded or returned to the Investors pursuant to this Section 1.</li>The Companys good faith determination of each Investors entitlement to interest shall be final and binding.<br><br><ul><li>(i)	The Company hereby grants to each Investor resident in the Provinces of Alberta, British
