weight  $356 Million<br>Adjusted Operating Margin  25% weight  11%<br>Adjusted EBITDAC  25% weight  $65 Million<br>-<br>The Minimum Achievement Level is determined by adding the weighted average of the full year Total Revenue Goal (i.e., Total Revenue Achieved (as defined below) multiplied by 50%), plus the weighted average of the Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted EBITDAC Goals (same formula).<br>If the sum of these percentages is equal to or greater than 85%, then a bonus is payable.<br><br>-<br>If the Bonus Achievement Level is between 85% and 100%, then Eligible Participants

Target Bonus Potential.<br><br>Bonus Multiplier:<br>-<br>If the Bonus Achievement Level is in excess of 100%, then Eligible Participants are eligible for 100% of their Total Bonus Potential, plus a percentage of their Total Bonus Potential equal to three times the portion in excess of 100%.<br>For example, if the Bonus Achievement Level is 110%, then Eligible Participants are eligible for 100%
