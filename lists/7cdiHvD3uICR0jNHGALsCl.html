from time to time upon the happening of certain events as follows:<br><ul><li>A.Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations</li>If the Company at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issuance Date effects a stock split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Exercise Price then in effect immediately before that stock split or subdivision shall be proportionately decreased and the number of shares of Common Stock theretofore receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased.<br>If the Company at any time or from

in effect shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Exercise Price then in effect by a fraction (1) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date and (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution; provided, however, that if such record date is fixed and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Exercise Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter the Exercise Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 5B as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions.<br><br><li>C.Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions</li>In the event the Company at any time or from time to time on or after the Original Issuance Date makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event provision shall be made so that the Holder of this Warrant shall receive upon conversion thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereupon, the amount of securities of the Company which the Holder would have received had this Warrant been exercised on the date of such event and had Holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the conversion date, retained such securities receivable by the Holder as aforesaid during such period, subject to all other adjustments called for during such period under this Section 5 with respect to the rights of the Holder of this Warrant.<br><br><li>D.Adjustment for

is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets, provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), then and in any such event the Holder of this Warrant shall have the right thereafter upon exercise of this Warrant to receive the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable by holders of Common Stock upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change, that the Holder would have received if this Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.<br><br><li>E.No Adjustments in Certain Circumstances</li>No adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least five ($0.05) cents in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 5E are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment required to be made hereunder.<br>All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.<br><br>4<br><li>F.Certificate as to Adjustments</li>Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 5, the Company at its expense shall

detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.<br>The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of a Warrant, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) Exercise Price at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the exercise of the Warrant.<br><br></ul><li>6.Notices of Record Date</li>In case:<br><ul><li>A. the Company shall take a record of the holders

consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, such notice shall be mailed at least ten (10) days prior to the date therein specified.</li><br></ul><li>7.Loss or
