2.2 Commencement Date</li>Upon the Effective Date, the terms and provisions hereof shall be fully binding on Landlord and Tenant.<br>The Term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date.<br>Unless sooner terminated or extended as may be hereinafter provided, the Term shall end on the Expiration Date.<br>If Landlord does not tender possession of the Premises to Tenant on or before any particular date, for any reason whatsoever, Landlord shall not be liable for any damage thereby (except as expressly set forth in this Section 2.2 below), this Lease shall not be void or voidable thereby, and the Term shall not commence until the Commencement Date.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord does not cause the Initial Installations (defined in the Work Letter) to be Substantially Completed on or before the date that is sixty (60) days following the full execution and delivery of this Lease by Landlord and Tenant (the Fixed Rent Abatement Outside Date), then Tenant shall be entitled to an abatement of Fixed Rent in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of days occurring after the Fixed Rent Abatement Outside Date and prior to the Commencement

been due but for the Fixed Rent abatement provided herein; or (ii) the entire unexpired portion of the Fixed Rent Abatement Period as of such default shall be moved to the end of the Term (provided that any Fixed Rent abatement in connection therewith shall not exceed $8,586.90 per month), and Tenant shall immediately be obligated to pay Fixed Rent at the full amounts of the monthly installments therefor set forth in Article 1 above.<br>The Fixed Rent Abatement Right set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be personal to the originally named Tenant under this Lease (the Original Tenant) and shall

term of five (5) years (the Renewal Term) commencing on the day after the expiration of the initial Term (the Renewal Term Commencement Date) and ending on the day immediately preceding the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Renewal Term Commencement Date, unless the Renewal Term shall sooner terminate pursuant to any of the terms of this Lease or otherwise.<br>The Renewal Term shall commence only if (i) Tenant notifies Landlord in writing (the Exercise Notice) of Tenants exercise of such renewal right not earlier than fifteen (15) months, and not later than nine (9) months, prior to the Expiration Date, (ii) at the time of the exercise of such right and immediately prior to the Renewal Term Commencement Date, no default under this Lease shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder, (iii) Tenant occupies the entire Premises at the time the Exercise Notice is given and immediately prior to the Renewal Term Commencement Date, and (iv) the Original Tenant exercises its renewal option, if at all, with respect to all of the Premises.<br>Time is of the essence with respect to the giving of the Exercise Notice.<br>The Renewal Term shall be upon all of the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, except that (a) the Rent for the Renewal Term shall be determined as provided in Section 2.5(b) below and (b) if Tenant exercises the renewal option set forth in this Section 2.5, then Tenant shall have no further right to renew the Term unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Landlord and Tenant.<br>Upon the commencement of the Renewal Term, (1) the Renewal Term shall be added to and become part of the Term, (2) any reference to this Lease, to the Term, the term of this Lease or any similar expression shall be deemed to include the Renewal Term and (3) the expiration of the Renewal Term shall become the Expiration Date.<br>Any termination, cancellation or surrender of the entire interest of Tenant under this Lease at any time during the Term shall automatically terminate the renewal right set forth in this Section 2.5.<br>The rights contained in this Section 2.5 shall be personal to Original Tenant, and may only be exercised by the Original Tenant (and not any assignee, sublessee or other transferee of the Original Tenants interest in this Lease).<br><br><li>(b) Renewal Term Rent</li>The annual Rent payable during the Renewal Term shall be equal to the annual Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of the Premises as of commencement of the Renewal Term (the Calculation Date).<br>Fair Market Value shall mean the fair market annual rent (including additional rent and considering any base year or expense stop applicable thereto), taking into account all escalations, at which, as of the Calculation Date, tenants are leasing non-sublease, non-renewal, non-encumbered, non-equity, non-expansion space comparable in size, location and quality to the Premises for a term equal to the Renewal Term, in an arms-length transaction, which comparable space is located in the Building, and which comparable transactions (collectively, the Comparable Transactions) are entered into within the six (6) month period immediately preceding Landlords delivery of the Rent Notice (as hereafter defined) to Tenant, taking into consideration the following concessions (the Concessions): (i) rental abatement concessions, if any, being granted such tenants in connection with such comparable space; (ii) tenant improvements or allowances provided or to be provided for such comparable space, taking into account, and deducting the value of, the existing improvements in the Premises, such value to be based upon the age, condition, design, quality of finishes and layout of the improvements and the extent to which the same can be utilized by a Tenant based upon the fact that the precise tenant improvements existing in the Premises are specifically suitable to Tenant; (iii) that the Base Year for Tenants lease of the Premises during the Renewal Term shall be adjusted to the calendar year in which the Renewal Term commences; and (iv) other reasonable monetary concessions being granted such tenants in connection with such comparable space; provided, however, that in calculating the Fair Market Value, no consideration shall be given to (A) the fact that Landlord is or is not required to pay a real estate brokerage commission in connection with Tenants exercise of its right to lease the Premises during the Renewal Term or in connection with the Comparable Transactions or the fact that landlords are or are not paying real estate brokerage commissions in connection with such comparable space, and (B) any period of rental abatement, if any, granted to tenants in Comparable Transactions in connection with the design, permitting and construction of tenant improvements in such comparable spaces.<br>The determination of Fair Market Value shall additionally include a determination (the Financial Security Determination) as to whether, and if so to what extent, Tenant must provide Landlord with financial security, such as a letter of credit or guaranty, for Tenants rent obligations in connection with Tenants lease of the Premises during the Renewal Term.<br>Such determination shall be made by reviewing the extent of financial security then generally being imposed in Comparable Transactions from tenants of comparable financial condition and credit history to the then existing financial condition and credit history of Tenant (with appropriate adjustments to account for differences in the then-existing financial condition of Tenant and such other tenants).<br>Landlord shall advise Tenant (the Rent Notice) of Landlords determination of Fair Market Value of the Premises for the Renewal Term prior to the Renewal Term Commencement Date.<br>If Tenant timely disputes Landlords determination of Fair Market Value in accordance with Section 2.5(c) below, then the dispute shall be resolved by arbitration as provided in Section 2.5(c) below.<br>If the Rent payable during the Renewal Term is not determined prior to the Renewal Term Commencement Date, then Tenant shall pay Rent in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value for the Premises as set forth in the Rent Notice (the Interim Rent).<br>Upon final determination of the Rent for the Renewal Term, Tenant shall commence paying such Rent as so determined, and within ten (10) days after such determination Tenant shall pay any deficiency in prior payments of Rent or, if the Rent as so determined shall be less than the Interim Rent, Tenant shall be entitled to a credit against the next succeeding installments of Rent in an amount equal to the difference between each installment of Interim Rent and the Rent as so determined that should have been paid for such installment until the total amount of the over payment has been recouped.<br><br>-5-<br><li>(c) Arbitration</li>If Tenant wishes to dispute Landlords determination of Fair Market Value of the Premises for the Renewal Term pursuant to Section 2.5(b) above, then Tenant shall give notice to Landlord of such dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Rent Notice and such dispute thereafter shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the then prevailing Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association or its successor for arbitration of commercial disputes, except that the Expedited Procedures shall be modified as follows:<br><ul><li>(i)In its demand for arbitration, Tenant shall specify the name and

due.<br>Such remedy may be exercised by Landlord without prejudice to its right thereafter to terminate this Lease in accordance with the other provisions contained in this Article 15.<br>Landlords reentry to perform acts of maintenance or preservation of, or in connection with efforts to relet, the Premises, or any portion thereof, or the appointment of a receiver upon Landlords initiative to

make any Work of Improvement to the Premises in connection therewith.<br>Tenant hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Landlord as its attorney-in-fact, which appointment shall be deemed coupled

retaking or repossessing the Premises, removing persons and property therefrom, securing new tenants, and, if Landlord maintains and operates the Premises, the costs thereof) and necessary or

Civil Code Section 1951.8, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161 et seq., or any similar, successor or related Requirements.<br><br><li>(b)If, after Tenants abandonment of the Premises, Tenant leaves behind any of Tenants Property, then Landlord shall store such Tenants Property at a warehouse or any other location at the risk, expense and for the account of Tenant, and such property shall be released only upon Tenants payment of such charges, together with moving and other costs relating thereto and all other sums due and owing under this Lease</li>If Tenant does not reclaim such Tenants Property within the period permitted by law, Landlord may sell such Tenants Property in accordance with law and apply the proceeds of such sale to any sums due and owing hereunder, or retain

payment of Rent is not paid when due, interest shall accrue on such payment, from the date such payment became due until paid at the Interest Rate.<br>Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant of Rent will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult and impracticable to fix.<br>Such costs include, without limitation, processing and accounting charges, and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any note secured by a Mortgage covering the Premises.<br>Therefore, in addition to interest, if any amount is not paid when due, a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of such amount shall be assessed; provided, however, that on two (2) occasions during any calendar year of the Term, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of such late payment and Tenant shall have a period of five (5) days thereafter in which to make such payment before any late charge is assessed.<br>Such interest and late charges are separate and cumulative and are in addition to and shall not diminish or represent a substitute for any of Landlords rights or remedies under any other provision of this Lease.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 15.7 Other Rights of Landlord</li>If Tenant fails to pay any Additional Rent when due, Landlord, in addition to any other right or remedy, shall have the same rights and remedies as in the case of a default by Tenant in the payment of Fixed Rent.<br>If Tenant is in arrears in the payment of Rent, Tenant waives Tenants right, if any, to designate the items against which any payments made by Tenant are to be credited, and Landlord may apply any payments made by Tenant to any items Landlord sees fit, regardless of any request by Tenant.<br><br>ARTICLE

with the efficient operation of the Building, (iii) results in a violation of any Requirement, or (iv) results or will result in a cancellation of any insurance policy maintained by Landlord, and (b)

any default by Tenant under this Lease, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord on demand, with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date incurred by Landlord.<br>Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Lease, all costs and expenses which, pursuant to this Lease are incurred by Landlord and payable to Landlord by Tenant, and all charges, amounts and sums payable to Landlord by Tenant for any property, material, labor, utility or other services which, pursuant to this Lease, are attributable directly to Tenants use and occupancy of the Premises or presence at the Building,

Landlords invoice for such amount.<br><br>ARTICLE 17<br>NO REPRESENTATIONS BY LANDLORD; LANDLORDS APPROVAL<br><li>Section 17.1 No Representations</li>Except as expressly set forth herein, Landlord and

not Landlord expressly agreed that such consent or approval would not be unreasonably withheld, Tenant shall not make or exercise, and Tenant hereby waives, any claim for money damages (including any claim by way of set-off, offset, counterclaim or defense) and/or any right to terminate this Lease based upon Tenants claim or assertion that Landlord unreasonably withheld or delayed its consent or approval.<br>Tenants sole remedy shall be an action or proceeding to enforce such provision, by specific performance, injunction or declaratory judgment.<br>In no event shall Landlord or the Parties (as that term is defined in Section 26.3, below) be liable for, and Tenant, on behalf of itself and all other Tenant Parties, hereby waives any claim for, any indirect, consequential or punitive

Property and Specialty Alterations.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 18.2 Holdover Rent</li>Landlord and Tenant recognize that Landlords damages resulting from Tenants failure to timely surrender possession of the Premises may be substantial, may exceed the amount of the Rent payable hereunder, and will be impossible to accurately measure.<br>Accordingly, if possession of the Premises is not surrendered to Landlord on the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease, in addition to any other rights or remedies Landlord may have hereunder or at law, Tenant shall (a) pay to Landlord for each month (or any portion thereof) during which Tenant holds over in the Premises after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease, a sum equal to (i) during the first thirty (30) days of such holdover, one-and-a-half (1-1/2) times the Rent payable under this Lease for the last full calendar month of the Term, and (ii) thereafter, two (2) times the Rent payable under this Lease for the last full calendar month of the Term, (b) be liable to Landlord for (1) any payment or rent concession which Landlord may be required to make to any tenant obtained by Landlord for all or any part of the Premises (a New Tenant) in order to induce such New Tenant not to terminate its lease by reason of the holding-over by Tenant, and (2) the loss of the benefit of the bargain if any New Tenant shall terminate its lease by reason of the holding-over by Tenant, and (c) indemnify Landlord against all claims for damages by any New Tenant.<br>No holding-over by Tenant, nor the payment to Landlord of the amounts specified above, shall operate to extend the Term hereof.<br>Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to permit Tenant to retain possession of the Premises after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease, and no acceptance by Landlord of payments from Tenant after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease shall be deemed to be other than on account of the amount to be paid by Tenant in accordance with the provisions of this Section 18.2.<br><br>ARTICLE 19<br>QUIET ENJOYMENT<br>Provided this Lease is in full force and effect and no Event

the Rules and Regulations, or of the right to exercise such election but the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect with respect to any subsequent breach, act or omission.<br>The receipt by Landlord of any Rent payable pursuant to this Lease or any other sums with knowledge of the breach of any covenant of this Lease shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach.<br>No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the monthly Rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than a payment on account of the earliest stipulated Rent, or as Landlord may elect to apply such payment, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment as Rent be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlords right to recover the balance of such Rent or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease.<br><br>ARTICLE 21<br>WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY;

portion, based on the proportion that the rentable area of such reoccupied portion of the Premises bears to the total rentable area of the Premises, shall be payable by Tenant from the date Tenant reoccupies such portion of the Premises.<br>Such right to abate Fixed Rent, Tenants Tax Payment, and Tenants Operating Payment shall be Tenants sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity for an Abatement Event.<br>To the extent Tenant is entitled to abatement without regard to the Eligibility Period because of an event described in Section 11.3 or Article 12 of this Lease, then the Eligibility Period shall not be applicable.<br>Except as provided in this Section 26.22, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to mean that Tenant is excused from paying Rent due

draw down an amount up to the face amount of the Letter of Credit if any of the following shall have occurred or be applicable: (1) such amount is due to Landlord under the terms and conditions of this Lease, or (2) Tenant has filed a voluntary petition under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any state bankruptcy code (collectively, Bankruptcy Code), or (3) an involuntary petition has been filed against Tenant under the Bankruptcy Code, or (4) the Bank has notified Landlord that the Letter of Credit will not be renewed or extended through the LC Expiration Date or (5) the long term rating of the Bank has been downgraded to BBB or lower (by Standard & Poors) or Baa2 or lower (by Moodys) and Tenant has failed to deliver a new Letter of Credit from a bank with a long term rating of A or higher (by Standard & Poors) or A2 or higher (by Moodys) and otherwise meeting the requirements set forth in this Article 27 within thirty (30) days following notice from Landlord.<br>The Letter of Credit will be honored by the Bank regardless of whether Tenant disputes Landlords right to draw upon the Letter of Credit.<br><br>-43-<br></ul><ul><li>Section 27.2 Transfer of Letter of Credit by

transfer (one or more times) all or any portion of its interest in and to the Letter of Credit to another party, person or entity, regardless of whether or not such transfer is separate from or as a part of the assignment by Landlord of its rights and interests in and to this Lease.<br>In the event of a transfer of Landlords interest in the Building, Landlord shall transfer the Letter of Credit, in whole or in part, to the transferee and thereupon Landlord shall, without any further agreement between the parties, be released by Tenant from all liability therefor, and it is agreed that the provisions hereof shall apply to every transfer or assignment of the whole or any portion of said Letter of Credit to a new landlord.<br>In connection with any such transfer of the Letter of Credit by Landlord, Tenant shall, at Tenants sole cost and expense, execute and submit to the Bank such applications, documents and instruments as may be necessary to effectuate such transfer, and Tenant shall be responsible for paying the Banks transfer and processing fees in connection therewith.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 27.3 Maintenance of Letter of Credit by Tenant</li>If, as a result of any drawing by Landlord on the Letter of Credit, the amount of the Letter of Credit shall be less than the Letter of Credit Amount, Tenant shall, within five (5) days thereafter, provide Landlord with additional letter(s) of credit in an amount equal to the deficiency, and any such additional letter(s) of credit shall comply with all of the provisions of this Article 27, and if Tenant fails to comply with the foregoing, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 15.1 of this Lease, the same shall constitute an incurable Event of Default by Tenant.<br>Tenant further covenants and warrants that it will neither assign nor encumber the Letter of Credit or any part thereof and that neither Landlord nor its successors or assigns will be bound by any such assignment, encumbrance, attempted assignment or attempted encumbrance.<br>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Letter of Credit expires earlier than the LC Expiration Date, Landlord will accept a renewal thereof (such renewal letter of credit to be in effect and delivered to Landlord, as applicable, not later than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Letter of Credit), which shall be irrevocable and automatically renewable as above provided through the LC Expiration Date upon the same terms as the expiring Letter of Credit or such other terms as may be acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion.<br>However, if the Letter of Credit is not timely renewed, or if Tenant fails to maintain the Letter of Credit in the amount and in accordance with the terms set forth in this Article 27, Landlord shall have the right to present the Letter of Credit to the Bank in accordance with the terms of this Article 27, and the proceeds of the Letter of Credit may be applied by Landlord against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that is not paid when due and/or to pay for all losses and damages that Landlord has suffered or that Landlord reasonably estimates that it will suffer as a result of any breach or default by Tenant under this Lease.<br>Any unused proceeds shall constitute the property of Landlord and need not be segregated from Landlords other assets.<br>Landlord agrees to pay to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the LC Expiration Date the amount of any proceeds of the Letter of Credit received by Landlord and not applied against any Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease that was not paid when due or used to pay for any losses and/or damages suffered by Landlord (or reasonably estimated by Landlord that it will suffer) as a result of any breach or default by Tenant under this Lease; provided, however, that if prior to the LC Expiration Date a voluntary petition is filed by Tenant, or an involuntary petition is filed against Tenant by any of Tenants creditors, under the Bankruptcy Code, then Landlord shall not be obligated to make such payment in the amount of the unused Letter of Credit proceeds until either all preference issues relating to payments under this Lease have been resolved in such bankruptcy or reorganization case or such bankruptcy or reorganization case has been dismissed.<br><br>-44-<br></ul><ul><li>Section 27.4 Landlords Right to Draw Upon Letter of Credit</li>Tenant hereby acknowledges and agrees that Landlord is entering into this Lease in material reliance upon the ability of Landlord to draw upon the Letter of Credit upon the occurrence of any breach or default on the part of Tenant under this Lease.<br>If Tenant shall breach any provision of this Lease or otherwise be in default hereunder, Landlord may, but without obligation to do so, and without notice to Tenant, draw upon the Letter of Credit, in part or in whole, to cure any breach or default of Tenant and/or to compensate Landlord for any and all damages of any kind or nature sustained or which Landlord reasonably estimates that it will sustain resulting from Tenants breach or default.<br>The use, application or retention of the Letter of Credit, or any portion thereof, by Landlord shall not prevent Landlord from exercising any other right or remedy provided by this Lease or by any applicable law, it being intended that Landlord shall not first be required to proceed against the Letter of Credit, and shall not operate as a limitation on any recovery to which Landlord may otherwise be entitled.<br>Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit, either prior to or following a draw by Landlord of any portion of the Letter of Credit, regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to Landlords right to draw upon the Letter of Credit.<br>No condition or term of this Lease shall be deemed to render the Letter of Credit conditional to justify the issuer of the Letter of Credit in failing to honor a drawing upon such Letter of Credit in a timely manner.<br>Tenant agrees and acknowledges that (a) the Letter of Credit constitutes a separate and independent contract between Landlord and the Bank, (b) Tenant is not a third party beneficiary of such contract, (c) Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof, and (d) in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenants bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlords claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b)(6) of the U.<br></ul><ul><li>S. Bankruptcy Code or otherwise</li><br></ul><ul><li>Section 27.5 Letter of Credit Not a Security Deposit</li>Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that in no event or circumstance shall the Letter of Credit or any renewal thereof or any proceeds thereof be (i) deemed to be or treated as a security deposit within the meaning of California Civil Code Section 1950.7, (ii) subject to the terms of such Section 1950.7, or (iii) intended to serve as a security deposit within the meaning of such Section 1950.7.<br>The parties hereto (A) recite that the Letter of Credit is not intended to serve as a security deposit and such Section 1950.7 and any and all other laws, rules and regulations applicable to security deposits in the commercial context (Security Deposit Laws) shall have no applicability or relevancy thereto and (B) waive any and all rights, duties and obligations either party may now or, in the future, will have relating to or arising from the Security Deposit Laws.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 27.6 Reduction of Letter of Credit Amount</li>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Article 27, provided Tenant is not then in default under
