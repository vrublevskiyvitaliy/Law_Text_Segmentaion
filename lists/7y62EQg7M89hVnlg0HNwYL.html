litigation or inquiries), demands and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all reasonable costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve any of them), whether or not involving a third party claim, as a result of, arising out of, or in any way related to (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Crosstex contained herein to be true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof (except with respect to any provisions including the word material or words of similar import, with respect to which such representations and warranties must have been true and correct) or (ii) the breach of any covenants of Crosstex contained herein, provided that, in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i), such claim for indemnification is made prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty; provided, however, that for purposes of determining when an indemnification claim has been made, the date upon which a Purchaser Related Party shall have given notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to Crosstex shall constitute the date upon which such claim has been made.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 5.02 Indemnification by the Purchaser</li>The Purchaser agrees to indemnify Crosstex, the General Partners and their respective Representatives (collectively, Crosstex Related Parties) from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all losses,

expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve any of them), whether or not involving a third party claim, as a result of, arising out of, or in any way related to (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Purchaser contained herein to be true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof or (ii) the breach of any of the covenants of the Purchaser contained herein, provided that, in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i), such claim for indemnification relating to a breach of any representation or warranty is made prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty; provided, however, that for purposes of determining when an indemnification claim has been made, the date upon which a Crosstex Related Party shall have given notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the Purchaser shall constitute the date upon which such claim has been made; provided, further, that the liability of the Purchaser shall not be greater in amount than the Purchase Price.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 5.03 Indemnification Procedure</li><br></ul><ul><li>A</li><br><li>(b) Promptly after any Crosstex Related Party or Purchaser Related Party (hereinafter, the Indemnified Party) has received notice of any indemnifiable claim hereunder, or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third person, which the Indemnified Party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement (each, a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give the indemnitor hereunder (the Indemnifying Party) written notice of such Third Party Claim but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure</li>Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such Third Party Claim to the extent then known.<br>The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in good faith.<br>If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend or settle such Third Party Claim, it shall promptly, and in no event later than five (5) days, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof and/or the settlement thereof.<br>Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and other information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the Indemnified Partys possession or control.<br>Such cooperation of the Indemnified Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party.<br>After the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to defend or settle any such asserted liability, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the<br>24<br>Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or settlement of such asserted liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (i) at its expense, to participate in the defense of such asserted liability and the negotiations of the settlement thereof and (ii) if (A) the Indemnifying Party has, within ten (10) Business Days of when the Indemnified Party provides written notice of a Third Party Claim, failed (y) to assume the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim and employ counsel and (z) notify the Indemnified Party of such assumption, or (B) if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such settlement or legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred.<br>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release from liability of, and does not contain any admission of wrong doing by, the Indemnified Party.<br><br></ul><ul><li>Section 5.04 Tax Matters</li>All indemnification payments under this Article V shall be adjustments to the Purchase Price except as otherwise required by applicable
