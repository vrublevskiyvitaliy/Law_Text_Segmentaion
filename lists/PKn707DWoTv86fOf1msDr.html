or reduction of its ability to sell the underlying shares of Common Stock (which remedy shall not be exclusive of any other remedies at law or in equity), the Company will pay as liquidated damages

applicable to such Non-Registered Shares.<br><br><li>(d)Liquidated Damages</li>The Company and the Investor hereto acknowledge and agree that the sums payable under subsection 2(c) above shall

grossly disproportionate to, the probable loss likely to be incurred in connection with any failure by the Company to obtain or maintain the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, (iii) one of the

the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.<br>The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.<br><br><li>(d)The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
