exhibit the Services in each System in its entirety when and as delivered by Network (including, without limitation, any openings, closings, interstitial programming, advertisements or sponsorships).</li>*****<br><li>(c) (i) Affiliate shall take all actions under its control to employ, maintain and upgrade such reasonable security systems and procedures (including maintenance of access control systems) consistent with customary cable television industry practice and as are necessary to effectively protect the programming contained on each Service and all materials related thereto from theft, pirating, unauthorized receipt or access, redistribution, unauthorized copying or duplication, including without limitation by fully encrypting the signal of each Service utilizing encryption technology commonly used in the domestic cable television industry.</li>Without limiting the foregoing, Affiliate will take all reasonable action under its control and consistent<br>2<br>with customary industry practice to protect the transmission, distribution and/or exhibition of all or any part of the programming contained on each Service through any digital outputs or any outputs of enhanced resolution analog signal on any set-top box that has digital outputs (e.g. any analog signal of image quality higher than 345,600 pixels per frame) by an effective content control/copy management system that prohibits the unauthorized transmission, distribution, exhibition, copying, recording, redistribution and/or transcription of all of any part of the program contained on the Service (a Copy Protection System) for that particular output.<br>With regard to any Copy Protection System, Affiliate shall take the steps required by that system (if any) to protect the programming contained on each Service in accordance with the Networks reasonable instructions and consistent with customary cable television industry practice.<br><br></ul></ul><ul><li>(ii) Affiliate shall not, and shall not authorize any other person to, copy, tape, or otherwise reproduce any part of either Service without Networks prior written authorization</li>Neither Affiliate nor any person distributing the Services in accordance herewith shall be responsible or liable for the recording of all or any part of the Services by Service Subscribers for their private, non-commercial use.<br>In addition, nothing in this Paragraph 4(c) shall be deemed to prohibit the recording by Affiliates Subscribers for their private, non-commercial use, or to prevent Affiliate from hooking up, installing or providing its Subscribers videocassette recorders or other similar recording devices and/or technologies, including but not limited to digital video recorders.<br><br><li>(iii) Network and Affiliate shall cooperate in good faith with respect to any material or information embedded by Network that is designed to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of the programming contained on either Service</li><br></ul><ul><li>(d) Network and Affiliate acknowledge that there is potentially excess signal distribution capacity contained within the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of each Services signal as received at each System</li>Without the prior written consent of Affiliate, Network shall not use any portion of this potentially excess VBI signal distribution bandwidth, except that Network may use the VBI for stereo, a second audio feed, closed captioning, V-chip program ratings information, any other data or information that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or other applicable federal, state or local law or regulation requires Network or Affiliate to transmit as part of a Service at any time within the bandwidth of the signal of a Service, or Affiliate test signals.<br>Affiliates Systems may exercise and exploit any distribution capacity contained within the bandwidth of the signal (including the VBI) by any means and in any locations in its discretion, provided however, such use by Affiliate or any System shall be a discrete use, separate and apart from the Services, and shall not (i) degrade (other than in an immaterial respect) the technical quality of the video and accompanying audio signal for the programming on either Service or (ii) adversely<br>3<br>disrupt or degrade (other than in an immaterial respect) the viewing experience of either Service.<br><br><li>(e) The Services will be sold, marketed, promoted and identified by Affiliate solely as MSG Plus (or MSG+) and MSG Network, as the case may be, and under no other name unless otherwise designated in writing by Network</li><br><li>(f) Network shall, at its own expense, deliver a signal of each Service, of a technical quality at least comparable to

agreed by the parties) and shall, at its own expense, fully encode the satellite signal of each Service, and shall authorize all System descramblers and other reception facilities and equipment furnished by Affiliate necessary to receive and descramble the satellite transmission of each Service signal and to deliver such signal to Service Subscribers</li>Except as otherwise provided herein (including pursuant to sub-sections (g) and (h) below), as between Affiliate and Network, Affiliate shall, at its sole expense, furnish an earth station and all other facilities and services necessary for the receipt of such satellite transmission and the delivery of such signal to the Service Subscribers.<br>Network hereby grants Affiliate the right to receive the feed of each Service, to digitize, compress, modify or otherwise technologically manipulate the feed (including the creation of a dual digital feed in addition to any analog feed of each Service), and to transmit the feed(s) as so altered and which shall be encrypted by Affiliate (the Altered Feeds) for distribution to terrestrial reception sites capable of receiving and utilizing the Altered Feeds and delivering such Altered Feeds to the System(s); provided that no such alteration, transmission, redistribution, reception or other use will cause any perceptible change in an average viewers perception of the principal video or principal audio presentation of the Services using commercially available consumer electronics equipment.<br><br><li>(g) In the event Network elects to change the satellite used for delivery of the Services, Network shall provide Affiliate with at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of such change</li>If as a result of such change Affiliate would have to incur incremental out-of-pocket expenses in order to receive and distribute the Services, then Affiliate may as its sole recourse discontinue distribution of the Services in any affected System as of the date of such change unless Network agrees promptly to reimburse such System for such Systems incremental expenses to acquire and install equipment necessary for such System to receive the signal of the Services from such new satellite.<br>Such reimbursement shall be for the Services pro rata share of such expenses, with the Services to share expenses equally with any other programming services that are participating in such change and are carried by such System.<br><br><li>(h) In the event Network changes its encryption technology, Network shall use reasonable efforts to provide Affiliate with at least ninety (90) days prior</li>4<br>written notice of such change.<br>If the new encryption technology is not compatible with a Systems then-existing descrambling equipment, then Affiliate may as its sole recourse discontinue distribution of the Services in any affected System as of the date of such change unless Network agrees promptly to reimburse such System for such Systems incremental out-of-pocket costs and expenses to acquire and install the equipment necessary for such System to descramble the signal of the Services subsequent to such change.<br>Such reimbursement shall be for the Services pro rata share of such expenses, with the Services to share expenses equally with any other programming services that also use the new encryption technology and are carried by such System.<br><br><ul><li>(i) Network shall provide Affiliate with an average of at least ***** of commercial announcement time per hour of programming in which national advertising spots are inserted, allocated on a reasonably even basis among the advertising spots inserted by Network</li>Such commercial announcement time shall be scheduled by Network, at Networks sole discretion with reasonable advance written notice to Affiliate, and shall be used, at Affiliates option, for insertion of national or local advertising and announcements.<br>As between Network and Affiliate, Affiliate shall have the right to retain for itself all of the proceeds derived from the sale of the commercial announcement time furnished to Affiliate hereunder.<br>***** Each use by Affiliate of the advertising

all reasonable, third party costs and expenses of any such audit which reveals an underpayment by Affiliate that is not the subject of a bona fide dispute for the period audited of more than ***** of the amount properly payable by Affiliate to Network hereunder for such period.<br><br><li>(e) Any amount not paid by Affiliate hereunder when due shall, at Networks option, accrue interest from the due date at the lesser of (i) one and one-half percent (11/2%) per month (ii) the maximum rate permitted by law</li><br><li>(f) *****</li><li>(g) (i) *****</li>6<br></ul><ul><li>(ii)
