during a Fundamental Change Conversion Period), subject in each case to adjustment as set forth in Section 4.01.</li><br><li>(b) In addition to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, each Holder that elects to convert its Notes prior to the Stated Maturity Date shall have the right to receive an amount in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid Interest on such converted

p.m., New York City time, on the Interest Record Date relating to such Interest Payment Date.<br>If any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the Company will pay the related Interest Payment on the next Business Day (without any interest or other payment resulting from the delay).<br>Interest Payments will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and, in the case of any incomplete month, the actual number of days elapsed during the month.<br>If the Stated Maturity Date or any Conversion Date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company will pay the Interest Payment on the next Business Day (without any interest or other payment resulting from the delay).<br>Interest Payments will include accrued Interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which Interest Payments have been paid, as the case may be, up to (but excluding) the Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity Date or Conversion Date, as the case may be.<br>The Interest Payments will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in New York City maintained for that purpose, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account appropriately designated by the Holder entitled<br>19<br>thereto or by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Persons address as it appears on the Security

fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of any Holder that are converted, that Holder shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of:</li><ul><li>(i) in the case of a mandatory conversion or conversion in connection with a Fundamental Change, the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Conversion Date; or</li><li>(ii) in the case of each Early Conversion, the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.</li><br></ul><li>(c) The number of full shares of Common Stock shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered by such Holder</li><br></ul><ul><li>Section 3.09 Charges and Taxes</li>The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the delivery of the Common Stock pursuant to the Notes; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes that may be payable in respect of any registration of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder surrendered in respect of the Notes evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Trustee, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to deliver such share certificates unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or registration thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have

Rates</li></ul><ul><li>(a) Each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be subject to the following adjustments:</li></ul><ul><li>(i) Stock Dividends and Distributions.</li>If the Company issues Common Stock to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City<br>20<br>time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution will be divided by a fraction:<br><ul><li>(A) the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination, and</li><li>(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution.</li><br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (i) will become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination.<br>If any dividend or distribution described in this clause (i) is declared but not so paid or made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to make such dividend or distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.<br>For the purposes of this clause (i), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination shall not include shares held in treasury by the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.<br>The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company.<br><br></ul><li>(ii) Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights.</li>If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights or warrants (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans), entitling such holders, for a period of up to 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants will be increased by multiplying such Fixed Conversion Rate by a fraction:<br><ul><li>(A) the numerator of which is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants, and</li><li>(B) the denominator of which is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination and the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of the aggregate offering price payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the Current Market Price.</li><br>21<br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (ii) will become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for such determination.<br>In the event that such rights or warrants described in this clause (ii) are not so issued, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to issue such rights or warrants, to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such issuance had not been declared.<br>To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or shares of Common Stock are otherwise not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.<br>In determining the aggregate offering price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof), whose determination shall be conclusive).<br>For the purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in treasury by the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.<br>The Company shall not issue any such rights or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company.<br><br></ul><li>(iii) Subdivisions and Combinations of the Common Stock.</li>If outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combined into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of such subdivision or combination shall be multiplied by a fraction:<br><ul><li>(A) the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that would be outstanding immediately after, and solely as a result of, such subdivision or combination, and</li><li>(B) the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision or combination.</li><br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iii) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the effective date of such subdivision or combination.<br><br></ul><li>(iv) Debt or Asset Distribution.</li><ul><li>(A) If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding (1) any dividend or distribution covered by Section 4.01(a)(i), (2) any rights or warrants covered by Section 4.01(a)(ii), (3) any dividend or distribution covered by Section 4.01(a)(v) and (4) any Spin-Off to which the provisions set forth in Section 4.01(a)(iv)(B) apply), each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination</li>22<br>of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be multiplied by a fraction:<br></ul></ul><ul><li>1. the numerator of which is the Current Market Price, and</li><li>2. the denominator of which is the Current Market Price minus the Fair Market Value, on such date fixed for determination, of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock</li><br></ul><ul><li>(B) In the case of a Spin-Off, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.</li></ul><ul><li>1. the numerator of which is the sum of (x) the Current Market Price and (y) the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of capital stock or similar equity interests so distributed which is applicable to one share of Common Stock as of the fifteenth Trading Day after the Ex-Date for such distribution (or, if such shares of capital stock or equity interests are listed on a national or regional securities exchange, the average of the Closing Prices of such securities for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on such fifteenth Trading Day), and</li><li>2. the denominator of which is the Current Market Price</li><br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (iv) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.<br>In the event that such distribution described in this clause (iv) is not so made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such dividend or distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.<br>If an adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate is required under this clause (iv) during any settlement period in respect of the Notes that have been tendered for conversion, delivery of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this clause (iv).<br><br></ul><ul><li>(v) Cash Distributions</li>If the Company distributes an amount exclusively in cash to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock (excluding (1) any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 4.01(e) applies, (2) any dividend or distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or<br>23<br>winding up of the Company or (3) any consideration payable in as part of a tender or exchange offer by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company), each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution will be multiplied by a fraction:<br><ul><li>(A) the numerator of which is the Current Market Price, and</li><li>(B) the denominator of which is the Current Market Price minus the amount per share of Common Stock of such distribution</li><br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (v) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date fixed for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution.<br>In the event that any distribution described in this clause (v) is not so made, each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to pay such distribution, to such Fixed Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.<br><br></ul><li>(vi) Self Tender Offers and Exchange Offers</li>If the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company successfully completes a tender or exchange offer pursuant to a Schedule TO or registration statement on Form S-4 for Common Stock (excluding any securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock), where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Current Market Price, each Fixed Conversion Rate in effect at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of expiration of the tender or exchange offer (the Tender Offer Expiration Date) will be multiplied by a fraction:<br><ul><li>(A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the sum of:</li><ul><li>a. the aggregate cash and Fair Market Value on the Tender Offer Expiration Date of any other consideration paid or payable for shares of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as of the Tender Offer Expiration Date; and</li><li>b. the product of the Current Market Price and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the last time tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the Tender Offer Expiration Time) on the Tender Offer Expiration Date; and</li></ul><li>(B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of the Current Market Price and the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Tender Offer Expiration Time on the Tender Offer Expiration Date</li><br>24<br>Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (vi) shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the seventh Trading Day immediately following the Tender Offer Expiration Date.<br>In the event that the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then each Fixed Conversation Rate shall be readjusted to such Fixed Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.<br>Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this clause (vi) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in each Fixed Conversation Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this clause (vi).<br>If an adjustment to each Fixed Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this clause (vi) during any settlement period in respect of the Notes that have been tendered for conversion, delivery of the related conversion consideration will be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this clause (vi).<br><br></ul><li>(vii) Except with respect to a Spin-Off, in cases where the Fair Market Value of assets (including cash), debt securities or certain rights, warrants or options to purchase securities of the Company as to which Section 4.</li><br><li>(viii) Rights Plans</li>To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect with respect to the Common Stock on any Conversion Date, upon conversion of any Notes, Holders shall receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation of such rights as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock as described in Section 4.01(a)(iv), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.<br><br></ul><ul><li>(b) Adjustment for Tax Reasons</li>The Company may make such increases in each Fixed Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 4.01, as<br>25<br>the Company deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire shares of Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons; provided that the same proportionate adjustment must be made to each Fixed Conversion Rate.<br><br><li>(c)Calculation of Adjustments; Adjustments to Threshold Appreciation Price, Initial Price and Stock Price</li><ul><li>(i) All adjustments to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock.</li>Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, no adjustment in a Fixed Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 4.01(c)(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; provided, however that with respect to adjustments to be made to the Fixed Conversion Rates in connection with cash dividends paid by the Company, the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be adjusted regardless of whether such aggregate adjustments amount to one percent or more of the Fixed Conversion Rates no later than March 15 of each calendar year; provided, further that on the earlier of the Mandatory Conversion Date, an Early Conversion Date and the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, adjustments to each Fixed Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not been taken into account before such date.<br><br><li>(ii) If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Sections 4.01(a) or 4.01(b), an inversely proportional adjustment shall also be made to the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price solely for purposes of determining which of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section 3.01 shall apply on the Mandatory Conversion Date.</li>Such adjustment shall be made by dividing each of the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Initial Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be either Fixed Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to Sections 4.01(a) or 4.01(b) and the denominator of which shall be such Fixed Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment.<br>The Company shall make appropriate adjustments to the Closing Prices prior to the relevant Ex-Date, effective date or Tender Offer Expiration Date, as the case may be, used to calculate the Applicable Market Value to account for any adjustments to the Initial Price, the Threshold Appreciation Price and the Fixed Conversion Rates that become effective during the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used for calculating the Applicable Market Value.<br><br><li>(iii) If:</li><ul><li>(A) the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after the end of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period used for calculating the Applicable Market Value and before the Mandatory Conversion Date; and</li><li>(B) such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holders had</li>26<br>such record date occurred on or before the last Trading Day of such 20-Trading Day period,<br>then the Company shall deem the Holders to be holders of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution.<br>In this case, the Holders would receive the dividend or distribution on Common Stock together with the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the Mandatory Conversion Date.<br><br></ul><li>(iv) If an adjustment is made to the Fixed Conversion Rates pursuant to Sections 4.01(a) or 4.01(b), a proportional adjustment shall be made to each Stock Price column heading set forth in the table included in Section 3.03(d).</li>Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying each Stock Price included in such table by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the Minimum Conversion Rate immediately after such adjustment.<br>Each of the Conversion Rates in the table included in Section 3.03(d) will be subject to adjustment in the same manner as each Fixed Conversion Rate as set forth in this Section 4.01.<br><br><li>(v) No adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates shall be made if Holders may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to an adjustment.</li>In addition, the applicable Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:<br><ul><li>(A) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Companys securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;</li><li>(B) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries;</li><li>(C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the Issue Date; or</li><li>(D) for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.</li><br></ul></ul><li>(d) Notice of Adjustment</li>Whenever the Fixed Conversion Rates and the Fundamental Change Conversion Rates are to be adjusted, the Company shall:<br><ul><li>(i) compute such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates and Fundamental Change Conversion Rates and prepare and transmit to the Trustee and any Conversion Agent an Officers Certificate setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates and Fundamental Change Conversion Rates, the method of calculation thereof in</li>27<br>reasonable detail and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based;<br><li>(ii) within five Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Fixed Conversion Rates and the Fundamental Change Conversion Rates (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware), provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to the Holders of the occurrence of such event; and</li><li>(iii) within five Business Days following the determination of such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates and Fundamental Change Conversion Rates provide, or cause to be provided, to the Holders a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to such Fixed Conversion Rates and Fundamental Change Conversion Rates, as applicable, was determined and setting forth such adjusted Fixed Conversion Rates or Fundamental Change Conversion Rates.</li><br></ul><li>(e) Reorganization Events</li>In the event of:<br><ul><li>(i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another Person);</li><li>(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company;</li><li>(iii) any reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock; or</li><li>(iv) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition),</li>in each case, as a result of which the Companys Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, securities, cash or property (each, a Reorganization Event), each Note outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind of securities, cash and other property (the Exchange Property) that such Holder would have been entitled to receive if such Holder had converted its Notes into Common Stock immediately prior to such Reorganization Event.<br>For purposes of the foregoing, the type and amount of Exchange Property in the case of any Reorganization Event that causes the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of shareholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election.<br>The number of units of Exchange Property for each Note converted following the Effective Date of such Reorganization Event shall be determined based on the Mandatory Conversion Rate, Minimum Conversion Rate or<br>28<br>Fundamental Change Conversion Rate, as the case may be, then in effect on the applicable Conversion Date (without any interest thereon and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Conversion Date).<br>The applicable Conversion Rate shall be (1) in the case of an Early Conversion Date, the Minimum Conversion Rate, and (2) otherwise, the Mandatory Conversion Rate as determined under Section 3.01 based upon the Applicable Market Value.<br><br>For purposes of this Section 4.01(e), Applicable Market Value shall be deemed to refer to the Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that compose all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that composes all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose.<br>For purposes of this Section 4.01(e), the term Closing Price shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.<br>For purposes of this Section 4.01(e), references to Common Stock in the definition of Trading Day shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property.<br><br>The above provisions of this Section 4.01(e) shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 4.01 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Company (or any successor) received by the holders of Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event.<br><br>The Company (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitute the Exchange Property.<br>Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Section 4.01(e).<br><br>ARTICLE V<br>EVENTS OF DEFAULT; ACCELERATION; REMEDIES<br></ul></ul><ul><li>Section 5.01 Events of Default</li></ul><ul><li>Section 5.1 of the Base
