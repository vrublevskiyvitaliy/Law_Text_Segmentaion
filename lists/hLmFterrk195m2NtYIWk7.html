WARRANT</li><br><ul><li>(a)Mechanics of Exercise</li>Subject to the terms and conditions hereof (including, without limitation, the limitations set forth in Section 1(f)), this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder on any day on or after the date hereof, in whole or in part, by delivery of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Exercise Notice), of the Holders election to exercise this Warrant.<br>Within one (1) Trading Day following an exercise of this Warrant as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver payment to the Company of an amount equal to the applicable Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares as to which this Warrant is being exercised (the Aggregate Exercise Price) in cash or wire transfer of immediately available funds if the Holder did not notify the Company in such Exercise Notice that such exercise was made pursuant to a Cashless Exercise (as defined in Section 1(d)).<br>The Holder shall not be required to deliver the original Warrant in order to effect an exercise<br>hereunder.<br>Execution and delivery of the Exercise Notice with respect to less than all of the Warrant Shares shall have the same effect as cancellation of the original Warrant and issuance of a new Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Shares.<br>On or before the first Business Day following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Notice to the Holder and the Companys transfer agent (the Transfer Agent).<br>On or before the third Business Day following the date on which the Company has received such Exercise Notice (the Share Delivery Date), the Company shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company (DTC) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, credit such aggregate number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holders or its designees balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and dispatch by overnight courier to the address as specified in the Exercise Notice or a legend is required on the Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.21 of the Exchange Agreement, a certificate, registered in the Companys share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise.<br>Upon delivery of the Exercise Notice, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date such Warrant Shares are credited to the Holders DTC account or the date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such Warrant Shares, as the case may be.<br>If this Warrant is submitted in connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1(a) and the number of Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Shares being acquired upon an exercise, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three Business Days after any exercise and at its own expense, issue a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is exercised.<br>No fractional Common Shares are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant, but rather the number of Common Shares to be issued shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.<br>The Company shall pay any and all taxes which may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Holder did not notify the Company in such Exercise Notice that such exercise was made pursuant to a Cashless Exercise (as defined in Section 1(d)), the Companys failure to deliver Warrant Shares to the Holder on or prior to the Trading Day in which the Company receives the Aggregate Exercise Price shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Warrant.<br><br><li>(b)Exercise Price</li>For purposes of this Warrant, Exercise Price means $2.37, subject to adjustment as provided herein.<br><br><li>(c)Companys Failure to Timely Delivery Securities</li>If the Company shall fail for any reason or for no reason to issue to the Holder within the later of (i) three (3) Business Days after the Companys receipt of the applicable Exercise Notice and (ii) two (2) Business Days after the Companys receipt of the Aggregate Exercise Price (or valid notice of a Cashless Exercise), a certificate for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled and register such Common Shares on the Companys share register or to credit the Holders balance account with DTC for such number of Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holders exercise of this Warrant, then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Holder, the Company shall pay in cash to the Holder on each day after such third Business Day that the issuance of such Common Shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 1.5% of the product of (A) the sum of the number of Common Shares not issued to the Holder on a timely basis and to which the Holder is entitled and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Shares on the trading day immediately preceding the last possible date which the Company could have issued such Common Shares to the Holder without violating Section 1(a).<br>In addition to the foregoing, if within the later of (i) three (3) Business Days after the Companys receipt of the applicable Exercise Notice and (ii) two (2) Business Days after the Companys receipt of the Aggregate Exercise Price (or valid notice of a Cashless Exercise) the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to the Holder and register such Common Shares on the Companys share register or credit the Holders balance account with DTC for the number of Common Shares to which the Holder is entitled upon such holders exercise hereunder, and if on or after such Business Day the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of Common Shares issuable upon such exercise that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company (a Buy-In), then the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Holders request and in the Holders discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holders total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Shares so purchased (the Buy-In Price), at which point the Companys obligation to<br>2<br>deliver such certificate (and to issue such Common Shares) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Common Shares and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of Common Shares, times (B) the Closing Bid Price on the date of exercise.<br><br><li>(d)Cashless Exercise</li>Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if a registration statement covering the Warrant Shares that are the subject of the Exercise Notice (the Unavailable Warrant Shares) is not available for the resale of such Unavailable Warrant Shares, the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this Warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price, elect instead to receive upon such exercise the Net Number of Common Shares determined according to the following formula (a Cashless Exercise):<br>Net Number = (A x B)  (A x C)<br>B<br>For purposes of the foregoing formula:<br>A =the total number of shares with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised.<br><br>B =the Closing Sale Price of the Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the applicable Exercise Notice.<br><br>C =the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrant Shares at the time of such exercise.<br><br>For purposes of Rule 144(d) promulgated under the Securities Act, as in effect on the date hereof, it is intended that the Warrant Shares issued in a Cashless Exercise shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the Subscription Date.<br><br><li>(e)Disputes</li>In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price or the arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares, the Company shall promptly issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares that are not disputed and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 12.<br><br><li>(f)Limitations on Exercises</li><br><ul><li>(i) Beneficial Ownership</li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant, this Warrant shall not be exercisable by the Holder hereof to the extent (but only to the extent) that the Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the Maximum Percentage) of the Common Shares.<br>To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether this Warrant shall be exercisable (vis--vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by the Holder) and of which such securities shall be exercisable (as among all such securities owned by the Holder) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be).<br>No prior inability to exercise this Warrant pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of exercisability.<br>For the purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.<br>The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor Holder of this Warrant.<br>The holders of Common Shares shall be third party beneficiaries of this paragraph and the Company may not waive this paragraph without the consent of holders of a majority of its Common Shares.<br>For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Common Shares then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of<br>3<br>convertible or exercisable securities into Common Shares, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Warrant or securities issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement or any Exchange Agreement.<br>By written notice to the Company, the Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Holder and not to any other holder of Exchange Warrants.<br><br><li>(ii) Principal Market Regulation</li>The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant if the issuance of such Common Stock would exceed the difference (as calculated immediately following the Exchange Date) between (x) that number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of this Warrant or the Exchange Notes or as payment of any Installment Amount (as defined in the Exchange Notes) or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Notes or this Warrant together with the Exchange Shares (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) without breaching the Companys obligations under the rules or regulations of the Principal Market and (y) the number of Exchange Shares issued pursuant to any Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Cap), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Principal Market for issuances of shares of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.<br>Until such approval or written opinion is obtained, no purchaser of the Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreements (the Purchasers) shall be issued in the aggregate, upon conversion or exercise, as applicable, of Exchange Notes or Exchange Warrants, or as payment of any Installment Amount hereunder or otherwise hereunder, Common Shares in an amount greater than the Exchange Cap Allocation of such Holder (as defined in the Exchange Notes).<br>In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Purchasers Exchange Notes, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation, and the restrictions of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation allocated to such transferee.<br>In the event that any Purchaser shall sell or otherwise transfer any Exchange Warrants to any transferee, such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation shall not be transferred with such Exchange Warrant to such transferee unless such Purchaser delivers written notice to the Company specifying (x) the identity of such transferee and (y) the amount of such Purchasers Exchange Cap Allocation being transferred to such transferee.<br>In the event that any holder of Exchange Notes on any given date shall convert all of such holders Exchange Notes into a number of Common Shares, which together with the number of Common Shares actually issued to such holder in connection with the Exchange Notes and Exchange Warrants of such holder on or prior to such date and any Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Exchange Warrants of such holder as of such date, in the aggregate, is less than such holders Exchange Cap Allocation, then the difference between such holders Exchange Cap Allocation and the sum of the number of Common Shares (w) actually issued upon conversion of, or otherwise in connection with, the Exchange Notes of such holder on or prior to such date, (x) actually issued upon exercise of the Exchange Warrants of such holder on or prior to such date and (y) issuable upon exercise of the Exchange Warrants of such holder as of such date shall be allocated to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of Exchange Notes on a pro rata basis in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchange Notes then held by each such holder or, if no Exchange Notes are then outstanding, to the remaining holders of Exchange Warrants on a pro rata basis in proportion to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Exchange Warrants then held by each such holder.<br><br></ul></ul><li>ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE AND NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES</li>The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:<br><ul><li>(a)Adjustment of Exercise Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Shares</li>If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any share split, share dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced.<br>If the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by combination, reverse share split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.<br><br>4<br></ul><li>RIGHTS UPON DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS</li>If the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Shares, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, shares or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a Distribution), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case:<br><ul><li>(a) any Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the Distribution shall be reduced, effective as of the close of business on such record date, to a price determined by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction of which (i) the numerator shall be the Closing Bid Price of the Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding such record date minus the value of the Distribution (as determined in good faith by the Companys Board of Directors) applicable to one Common Share, and (ii) the denominator shall be the Closing Bid Price of the Common Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding such record date; and</li><li>(b) the number of Warrant Shares shall be increased to a number of shares equal to the number of Common Shares obtainable immediately prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of holders of Common Shares entitled to receive the Distribution multiplied by the reciprocal of the fraction set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph (a); provided that in the event that the Distribution is of Common Shares (or common shares) (Other Common Shares) of a company whose common shares are traded on a national securities exchange or a national automated quotation system, then the Holder may elect to receive a warrant to purchase Other Common Shares in lieu of an increase in the number of Warrant Shares, the terms of which shall be identical to those of this Warrant, except that such warrant shall be exercisable into the number of shares of Other Common Shares that would have been payable to the Holder pursuant to the Distribution had the Holder exercised this Warrant immediately prior to such record date and with an aggregate exercise price equal to the product of the amount by which the exercise price of this Warrant was decreased with respect to the Distribution pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding paragraph (a) and the number of Warrant Shares calculated in accordance with the first part of this paragraph (b)</li><br></ul><li>PURCHASE RIGHTS</li><br><ul><li>(a)Purchase Rights</li>Except with respect to such dividends or other distributions in which an adjustment has been made to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 2(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase shares, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Shares (the Purchase Rights), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that the Holders right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such Common Shares as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage)..<br><br><li>(b)Fundamental Transactions</li>The Company shall not consummate a Fundamental Transaction (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or permit the consummation of any Involuntary Change of Control unless (i) (x) the Successor Entity (if a Person other than the Company) assumes in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section (4)(b) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver to each holder of Exchange Warrants in exchange for such Exchange Warrants a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant, including, without limitation, an adjusted exercise price equal to the value for the Common Shares reflected by the terms of such Fundamental Transaction, and exercisable for a corresponding number of share capital equivalent to the Common<br>5<br>Shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and (y) the Successor Entity (if a Person other than the Company) is a publicly traded corporation whose common stock is quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market (a Public Successor Entity) (each such Fundamental Transaction, an Assumption Fundamental Transaction) or (ii) solely with respect to Fundamental Transactions that are not Assumption Fundamental Transactions, no Event of Default (as defined in the Exchange Notes) has occurred and is continuing and the Company has complied (or will comply in all respects, solely with respect to the payment of any Black Scholes Value to the Holder in accordance with Section 4(c) below or the delivery of any notice of any Fundamental Transaction that in accordance with this Section 4 or Section 8 is scheduled to occur after the consummation of such Change of Control) in all respects with its obligations pursuant to Sections 4(b), 4(c) and 8 hereof, including without limitation, the delivery of the notice of such Fundamental Transaction and with respect to any Black Scholes Notice delivered by the Holder either (x) prior to the date of the consummation of such Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (y) prior to twenty (20) Trading Days after either (A) the date of the consummation of such Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (B) the later of (I) the date of the consummation of such Involuntary Change of Control and (II) the date of the Holders receipt of a written notice from the Company with respect to such Involuntary Change of Control, the payment of the Black Scholes Value to the Holder in accordance with Section 4(c) below on or prior to the applicable Black Scholes Payment Date.<br>Upon the occurrence of any Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant referring to the Company shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as if such Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) had been named as the Company herein.<br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, but except with respect to an Assumption Fundamental Transaction in which the Company does not survive the consummation thereof, the Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written notice to the Company to waive this Section 4(b) to permit the Assumption Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of this Warrant.<br>Upon consummation of the Assumption Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to the Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon exercise of this Warrant at any time after the consummation of the Assumption Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the Common Shares (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior to such Assumption Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common stock (or its equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant.<br>In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of Common Shares are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Shares (a Corporate Event), the Company shall (or, with respect to any tender offer Involuntary Change of Control, shall use its reasonable best efforts to) make appropriate provision to insure that the Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon an exercise of this Warrant at any time after the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction but prior to the Expiration Date, in lieu of the Common Shares (or other securities, cash, assets or other property) purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrant prior to such Fundamental Transaction or the publicly traded stock (or its equivalents) of the Successor Entity upon an Assumption Fundamental Transaction, such shares, securities, cash, assets or any other property whatsoever (including warrants or other purchase or subscription rights) which the Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had the Warrant been exercised immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction.<br>Provision made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders.<br>If holders of Common Shares are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.<br>The provisions of this Section shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant.<br><br><li>(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Section 4(b) above, in the event of a Change of Control, if the Holder has not exercised the Warrant in full prior to the consummation of the Change of Control, then the Holder shall have the right by written notice to the Company (the Black Scholes Notice) to require the Company (or such Successor Entity, as applicable) to purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the Holder, either (i) concurrently with the consummation of such Change of Control if such notice is received prior to the consummation of such Change of Control or (ii) within five (5) Trading Days after the Companys receipt of</li>6<br>such Black Scholes Notice otherwise (such applicable payment date, the Black Scholes Payment Date), in lieu of the warrant referred to in Section 4(b), cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant as calculated on either (x) the date of the consummation of such Change of Control (other than an Involuntary Change of Control) or (y) the date of the Black Scholes Notice with respect to any Involuntary Change of Control.<br><br></ul><li>NONCIRCUMVENTION</li>The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Warrant and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder.<br>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of any Common Shares receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, (ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Common Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (iii) shall, so long as any of the Exchange Warrants are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Shares, solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of the Exchange Warrants, 100% of the number of Common Shares as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the exercise of the Exchange Warrants then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on exercise).<br><br><li>WARRANT HOLDER NOT DEEMED A STOCKHOLDER</li>Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Holder, solely in such Persons capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of share capital of the Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in such Persons capacity as the Holder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether any reorganization, issue of shares, reclassification of shares, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the Warrant Shares which such Person is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant.<br>In addition,
