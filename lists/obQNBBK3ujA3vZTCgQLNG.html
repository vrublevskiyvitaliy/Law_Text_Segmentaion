the registered holders such shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance w ith the foregoing provisions, such holders may be entitled to purchase.<br><br><li>FORM OF WARRANT</li>This Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to the terms herein, and any form of warrant issued after such adjustment may state the same Purchase Price and the same number of shares as is stated in this Warrant.<br>However, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of this Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any warrant thereafter issued, whether in exchange or substitution for this Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.<br>The Company agrees to notify the
