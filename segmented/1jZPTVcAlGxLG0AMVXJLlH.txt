**********************
RECITALS A.It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of a Change of Control (as defined below).

B.The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide the Employee with an incentive to continue his employment and to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
**********************
C.In order to provide the Employee with enhanced financial security and sufficient encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control, the Board believes that it is important to provide the Employee with certain severance benefits upon the Employees termination of employment following a Change of Control.

**********************
5.Six Month Hold-Back.
To the extent (i)any payments or benefits to which Employee becomes entitled under this Agreement, or any agreement or plan referenced herein, in connection with Employees termination of employment with the Company constitute deferred compensation subject to Section409A of the Code and (ii)the Employee is deemed at the time of such termination of employment to be a specified employee under Section409A of the Code, then such payments shall not be made or commence until the earliest of (A)the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Employees separation from service (as such term is at the time defined in Treasury Regulations under Section409A of the Code) from the Company; or (B)the date of the Employees death following such separation from service; provided, however, that such deferral shall only be effected to the extent required to avoid adverse tax treatment to the Employee, including (without limitation) the additional twenty percent (20%) tax for which the Employee would otherwise be liable under Section409A(a)(1)(B)of the Code in the absence of such deferral.

(b)delivered as to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, with any such reductions first being made to the equity portion of the benefits and second being made to the cash portion of the benefits,
**********************
whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Employee on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section4999 of the Code.
