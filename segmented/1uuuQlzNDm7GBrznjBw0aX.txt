The term of exercisability of any Option may not be extended or renewed except as may be permitted by Code section 409A.
**********************
7.02 Transferability of Options.
Non-Qualified Share Options may be transferable by a Participant and exercisable by a person other than a Participant, but only to the extent such transfer is not made for value and is specifically provided in an Option Agreement and subject to applicable securities law requirements.
Incentive Stock Options, by their terms, shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable, during the Participants lifetime, only by the Participant.

For purposes of determining the applicability of Code section 422 (relating to Incentive Stock Options), or in the event that the terms of any Grant provide that it may be exercised only during employment or within a specified period of time after termination of employment, the Committee may decide to what extent leaves of absence for governmental or military service, illness, temporary Disability, or other reasons shall not be deemed interruptions of continuous employment.

An Option granted under this Plan may be exercised with respect to any number of whole shares less than the full number for
**********************

**********************
which the Option could be exercised.
Such partial exercise of an Option shall not affect the right to exercise the Option from time to time in accordance with this Plan with respect to remaining shares subject to the Option.

If the Agreement provides, payment of all or part of the Option Price (and any applicable withholding taxes) may be made by surrendering (by either actual delivery or attestation) already owned Ordinary Shares to the Company or by the Company withholding Ordinary Shares from the Participant upon exercise, provided the shares surrendered or withheld have a Fair Market Value (determined as of the day preceding the date of exercise) that is not less than such price or part thereof and any such withholding taxes.
In addition, the Committee may establish such payment or other terms as it may deem to be appropriate and consistent with these purposes.
**********************

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to shares subject to his or her Option until the date he or she exercises such Option.
