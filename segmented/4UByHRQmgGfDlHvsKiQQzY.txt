**********************
4.Term; Possession.
The Term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall end on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Lease.If Landlord is delayed in delivering possession of all or any portion of the Premises to Tenant as of the Commencement Date, Tenant will take possession on the date Landlord delivers possession, which date will then become the Commencement Date (and the Expiration Date will be extended so that the length of the Term remains unaffected by such delay).Landlord shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Tenant resulting from any delay in delivering possession due to the holdover of any existing tenant or other circumstances outside of Landlords reasonable control.
**********************
5.Rent; Taxes.
Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, without demand, deduction or offset, Minimum Annual Rent and Annual Operating Expenses for the Term.Tenant shall pay the Monthly Rent, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the Term, at Landlords address designated in Section1 above unless Landlord designates otherwise; provided that Monthly Rent for the third full month shall be paid at the signing of this Lease.If the Commencement Date is not the first day of the month, the Monthly Rent for that partial month shall be apportioned on a per diem basis at the rate of $142.66 per day and shall be paid on or before the Commencement Date.Tenant shall pay Landlord a service and handling charge equal to 5% of any Rent not paid within 5 business days after the date due.In addition, any Rent, including such charge, not paid within 5 days after the due date will bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date due to the date paid.Tenant shall pay before delinquent all taxes levied or assessed upon, measured by, or arising from: (a) the conduct of Tenants business; (b) Tenants leasehold estate; or (c) Tenants property.Additionally, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all sales, use, transaction privilege, or other excise tax that may at any time be levied or imposed upon, or measured by, any amount payable by Tenant under this Lease.
**********************
6.Operating Expenses.
The amount of the Annual Operating Expenses set forth in Section 1(g) above represents Tenants Share of the estimated Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which the Term commences.Landlord may adjust such amount from time to time if the estimated Annual Operating Expenses increase or decrease; Landlord may also invoice Tenant separately from time to time for Tenants Share of any extraordinary or unanticipated Operating Expenses.By April30th of each year (and as soon as practical after the expiration or termination of this Lease or, at Landlords option, after a sale of the Property), Landlord shall provide Tenant with a statement of Operating Expenses for the preceding calendar year or part thereof.Within 30 days after delivery of the statement to Tenant, Landlord or Tenant shall pay to the other the amount of any overpayment or deficiency then due from one to the other or, at Landlords option, Landlord may credit Tenants account for any overpayment.If Tenant does not give Landlord notice within 30 days after receiving Landlords statement that Tenant disagrees with the statement and specifying the items and amounts in dispute, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the statement.Landlords and Tenants obligation to pay any overpayment or deficiency due the other pursuant to this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, Landlord may, in its reasonable discretion, determine from time to time the method of computing and allocating Operating Expenses, including the method of allocating Operating Expenses to various types of space within the Building to reflect any disparate levels of services provided to different types of space.If the Building is not fully occupied during any period, Landlord may make a reasonable adjustment based on occupancy in computing the Operating Expenses for such period so that Operating Expenses are computed as though the Building had been fully occupied.The Building is intended to be part of a multi-building development on the Property and adjacent properties (the Development).Landlord may, at its option, treat the entire Development, or any portion thereof, as a single unified project for purposes of determining and allocating certain Operating Expenses that relate to the entire Development, such as real estate taxes.In such event, such Operating Expenses as Landlord elects to allocate based on the entire Development shall include the aggregate amount thereof for all buildings on the Property and adjacent properties and their attendant common areas included in the unified project, and Tenants Share with respect to such Operating Expenses shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of rentable square feet of the Premises and the denominator of which is the number of rentable square feet of all buildings on the Property and adjacent properties.
**********************
7.Services.
Landlord will furnish the following services for the normal use and occupancy of the Premises for general office purposes:(i)electricity, (ii)heating and air conditioning in season during Normal Business Hours, (iii)water, (iv)trash removal and janitorial services pursuant to the cleaning schedule attached as Exhibit D, and (v)such other services Landlord reasonably determines are appropriate or necessary.If Tenant requests, and if Landlord is able to furnish, services in addition to those identified above, including heating or air conditioning outside of Normal Business Hours, Tenant shall pay Landlords reasonable charge for such supplemental services.If because of Tenants density, equipmentor other Tenant circumstances, Tenant puts demands on the Building Systems in excess of those of the typical office user in the Building, Landlord may install supplemental equipment and meters at Tenants expense.Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for any interruption in such services, nor shall such interruption affect the continuation or validity of this Lease.Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any utility service is not delivered for a period in excess of five (5) consecutive business days solely as a result of the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, and if Tenant is unable to reasonably use the Premises for the conduct of its business by reason thereof, Rent shall thereafter abate until the interrupted service is restored or Tenant conducts or is able to reasonably conduct business in the Premises.Landlord shall have the exclusive right to select, and to change, the companies providing such services to the Building or Premises.Any wiring, cabling or other equipment necessary to connect Tenants telecommunications equipment shall be Tenants responsibility, and shall be installed in a manner approved by Landlord.In the event Tenants consumption of any utility or other service included in Operating Expenses is excessive when compared with other occupants of the Property, Landlord may invoice Tenant separately for, and Tenant shall pay on demand, the cost of Tenants excessive consumption, as reasonably determined by Landlord.

(b)Landlords consent shall not be required in the event of any Transfer by Tenant to an Affiliate provided that (i)the Affiliate has a tangible net worth at least equal to that of Tenant as of the date of this Lease, (ii) Tenant provides Landlord notice of the Transfer at least 15 days prior to the effective date, together with current financial statements of the Affiliate certified by an executive officer of the Affiliate, and (iii) in the case of an assignment or sublease, Tenant delivers to Landlord an assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to Landlord executed by Tenant and the Affiliate, together with a certificate of insurance evidencing the Affiliates compliance with the insurance requirements of Tenant under this Lease.
**********************

**********************
(d)If Tenant requests Landlords consent to a Transfer, Tenant shall provide Landlord, at least 15 days prior to the proposed Transfer, current financial statements of the transferee certified by an executive officer of the transferee, a complete copy of the proposed Transfer documents, and any other information Landlord reasonably requests.Immediately following any approved assignment or sublease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to Landlord executed by Tenant and the transferee, together with a certificate of insurance evidencing the transferees compliance with the insurance requirements of Tenant under this Lease.Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for reasonable administrative and attorneys fees in connection with the processing and documentation of any Transfer for which Landlords consent is requested.
**********************
19.Subordination; Mortgagees Rights.
**********************
(a)Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any Mortgage now or in the future affecting the Premises, provided that Tenants right of possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Mortgagee so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease.This clause shall be self-operative, but within 10 days after request, Tenant shall execute and deliver any further instruments confirming the subordination of this Lease and any further instruments of attornment that the Mortgagee may reasonably request.However, any Mortgagee may at any time subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease, without Tenants consent, by giving notice to Tenant, and this Lease shall then be deemed prior to such Mortgage without regard to their respective dates of execution and delivery; provided that such subordination shall not affect any Mortgagees rights with respect to condemnation awards, casualty insurance proceeds, intervening liens or any right which shall arise between the recording of such Mortgage and the execution of this Lease.
**********************
(b)No Mortgagee shall be (i) liable for any act or omission of a prior landlord, (ii) subject to any rental offsets or defenses against a prior landlord, (iii) bound by any amendment of this Lease made without its written consent, or (iv) bound by payment of Monthly Rent more than one month in advance or liable for any other funds paid by Tenant to Landlord unless such funds actually have been transferred to the Mortgagee by Landlord.

2.Premises.Landlord leases to Tenant and Tenant leases from Landlord the Premises, together with the right in common with others to use the Common Areas.Tenant accepts the Premises, Building and Common Areas AS IS, without relying on any representation, covenant or warranty by Landlord other than as expressly set forth in this Lease.Landlord and Tenant (a)acknowledge that all square foot measurements are approximate and (b)stipulate and agree to the rentable square footages set forth in Sections1(a) and (b) above for all purposes with respect to this Lease.
**********************
3.Use.Tenant shall occupy and use the Premises only for the Use specified in Section l above.Tenant shall not permit any conduct or condition which may endanger, disturb or otherwise interfere with any other Building occupants normal operations or with the management of the Building.Tenant may use all Common Areas only for their intended purposes.Landlord shall have exclusive control of all Common Areas at all times.
**********************
4.Term; Possession.
The Term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall end on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Lease.If Landlord is delayed in delivering possession of all or any portion of the Premises to Tenant as of the Commencement Date, Tenant will take possession on the date Landlord delivers possession, which date will then become the Commencement Date (and the Expiration Date will be extended so that the length of the Term remains unaffected by such delay).Landlord shall not be liable for any loss or damage to Tenant resulting from any delay in delivering possession due to the holdover of any existing tenant or other circumstances outside of Landlords reasonable control.
**********************
5.Rent; Taxes.
Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, without demand, deduction or offset, Minimum Annual Rent and Annual Operating Expenses for the Term.Tenant shall pay the Monthly Rent, in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during the Term, at Landlords address designated in Section1 above unless Landlord designates otherwise; provided that Monthly Rent for the third full month shall be paid at the signing of this Lease.If the Commencement Date is not the first day of the month, the Monthly Rent for that partial month shall be apportioned on a per diem basis at the rate of $142.66 per day and shall be paid on or before the Commencement Date.Tenant shall pay Landlord a service and handling charge equal to 5% of any Rent not paid within 5 business days after the date due.In addition, any Rent, including such charge, not paid within 5 days after the due date will bear interest at the Interest Rate from the date due to the date paid.Tenant shall pay before delinquent all taxes levied or assessed upon, measured by, or arising from: (a) the conduct of Tenants business; (b) Tenants leasehold estate; or (c) Tenants property.Additionally, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all sales, use, transaction privilege, or other excise tax that may at any time be levied or imposed upon, or measured by, any amount payable by Tenant under this Lease.
**********************
6.Operating Expenses.
The amount of the Annual Operating Expenses set forth in Section 1(g) above represents Tenants Share of the estimated Operating Expenses for the calendar year in which the Term commences.Landlord may adjust such amount from time to time if the estimated Annual Operating Expenses increase or decrease; Landlord may also invoice Tenant separately from time to time for Tenants Share of any extraordinary or unanticipated Operating Expenses.By April30th of each year (and as soon as practical after the expiration or termination of this Lease or, at Landlords option, after a sale of the Property), Landlord shall provide Tenant with a statement of Operating Expenses for the preceding calendar year or part thereof.Within 30 days after delivery of the statement to Tenant, Landlord or Tenant shall pay to the other the amount of any overpayment or deficiency then due from one to the other or, at Landlords option, Landlord may credit Tenants account for any overpayment.If Tenant does not give Landlord notice within 30 days after receiving Landlords statement that Tenant disagrees with the statement and specifying the items and amounts in dispute, Tenant shall be deemed to have waived the right to contest the statement.Landlords and Tenants obligation to pay any overpayment or deficiency due the other pursuant to this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, Landlord may, in its reasonable discretion, determine from time to time the method of computing and allocating Operating Expenses, including the method of allocating Operating Expenses to various types of space within the Building to reflect any disparate levels of services provided to different types of space.If the Building is not fully occupied during any period, Landlord may make a reasonable adjustment based on occupancy in computing the Operating Expenses for such period so that Operating Expenses are computed as though the Building had been fully occupied.The Building is intended to be part of a multi-building development on the Property and adjacent properties (the Development).Landlord may, at its option, treat the entire Development, or any portion thereof, as a single unified project for purposes of determining and allocating certain Operating Expenses that relate to the entire Development, such as real estate taxes.In such event, such Operating Expenses as Landlord elects to allocate based on the entire Development shall include the aggregate amount thereof for all buildings on the Property and adjacent properties and their attendant common areas included in the unified project, and Tenants Share with respect to such Operating Expenses shall be equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of rentable square feet of the Premises and the denominator of which is the number of rentable square feet of all buildings on the Property and adjacent properties.
**********************
7.Services.
Landlord will furnish the following services for the normal use and occupancy of the Premises for general office purposes:(i)electricity, (ii)heating and air conditioning in season during Normal Business Hours, (iii)water, (iv)trash removal and janitorial services pursuant to the cleaning schedule attached as Exhibit D, and (v)such other services Landlord reasonably determines are appropriate or necessary.If Tenant requests, and if Landlord is able to furnish, services in addition to those identified above, including heating or air conditioning outside of Normal Business Hours, Tenant shall pay Landlords reasonable charge for such supplemental services.If because of Tenants density, equipmentor other Tenant circumstances, Tenant puts demands on the Building Systems in excess of those of the typical office user in the Building, Landlord may install supplemental equipment and meters at Tenants expense.Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for any interruption in such services, nor shall such interruption affect the continuation or validity of this Lease.Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any utility service is not delivered for a period in excess of five (5) consecutive business days solely as a result of the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, and if Tenant is unable to reasonably use the Premises for the conduct of its business by reason thereof, Rent shall thereafter abate until the interrupted service is restored or Tenant conducts or is able to reasonably conduct business in the Premises.Landlord shall have the exclusive right to select, and to change, the companies providing such services to the Building or Premises.Any wiring, cabling or other equipment necessary to connect Tenants telecommunications equipment shall be Tenants responsibility, and shall be installed in a manner approved by Landlord.In the event Tenants consumption of any utility or other service included in Operating Expenses is excessive when compared with other occupants of the Property, Landlord may invoice Tenant separately for, and Tenant shall pay on demand, the cost of Tenants excessive consumption, as reasonably determined by Landlord.

**********************
(b)Tenant, at its expense, shall keep in effect commercial general liability insurance, including blanket contractual liability insurance, covering Tenants use of the Property, with such coverages and limits of liability as Landlord may reasonably require, but not less than a $1,000,000 combined single limit with a $3,000,000 general aggregate limit (which general aggregate limit may be satisfied by an umbrella liability policy) for bodily injury or property damage; however, such limits shall not limit Tenants liability hereunder.The policy shall name Landlord, Liberty Property Trust and any other associated or affiliated entity as their interests may appear and at Landlords request, any Mortgagee(s), as additional insureds, shall be written on an occurrence basis and not on a claims made basis and shall be endorsed to provide that it is primary to and not contributory to any policies carried by Landlord and to provide that it shall not be cancelable or reduced without at least 30 days prior notice to Landlord.The insurer shall be authorized to issue such insurance, licensed to do business and admitted in the state in which the Property is located and rated at least A VII in the most current edition of Bests Insurance Reports.Tenant shall deliver to Landlord on or before the Commencement Date or any earlier date on which Tenant accesses the Premises, and at least 30 days prior to the date of each policy renewal, a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage.

(d)Tenant shall not be permitted to satisfy any of its insurance obligations set forth in this Lease through any self-insurance or self-insured retention in excess of $25,000.
**********************
(e)Subject to subsection (c) above, and except to the extent caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its Agents, Tenant will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and its Agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, liability and expense (including reasonable fees of attorneys, investigators and experts) which may be asserted against, imposed upon, or incurred by Landlord or its Agents and arising out of or in connection with loss of life, personal injury or damage to property in or about the Premises or arising out of the occupancy or use of the Property by Tenant or its Agents or occasioned wholly or in part by any act or omission of Tenant or its Agents, whether prior to, during or after the Term.Tenants obligations pursuant to this subsection shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

(b)Tenant will comply, and will cause its Agents to comply, with the Building Rules.

**********************
16.Condemnation.
If (a)all of the Premises are Taken, (b)any part of the Premises is Taken and the remainder is insufficient in Landlords opinion for the reasonable operation of Tenants business, or (c)any of the Property is Taken, and, in Landlords opinion, it would be impractical or the condemnation proceeds are insufficient to restore the remainder, then this Lease shall terminate as of the date the condemning authority takes possession.If this Lease is not terminated, Landlord shall restore the Building to a condition as near as reasonably possible to the condition prior to the Taking, the Minimum Annual Rent shall be abated for the period of time all or a part of the Premises is untenantable in proportion to the square foot area untenantable, and this Lease shall be amended appropriately.The compensation awarded for a Taking shall belong to Landlord.Except for any relocation benefits to which Tenant may be entitled, Tenant hereby assigns all claims against the condemning authority to Landlord, including, but not limited to, any claim relating to Tenants leasehold estate.
**********************

18.Assignment and Subletting.
**********************
(a)Except as provided in Section (b) below, Tenant shall not enter into nor permit any Transfer voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.Without limitation, Tenant agrees that Landlords consent shall not be considered unreasonably withheld if (i) the proposed transferee is an existing tenant of Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord, (ii) the business, business reputation, or creditworthiness of the proposed transferee is unacceptable to Landlord, (iii) Landlord or an affiliate of Landlord has comparable space available for lease by the proposed transferee in the Development, or (iv) Tenant is in default under this Lease or any act or omission has occurred which would constitute a default with the giving of notice and/or the passage of time.A consent to one Transfer shall not be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent Transfer.In no event shall any Transfer relieve Tenant from any obligation under this Lease.Landlords acceptance of Rent from any person shall not be deemed to be a waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any Transfer.Any Transfer not in conformity with this Section 18 shall be void at the option of Landlord.
**********************
(b)Landlords consent shall not be required in the event of any Transfer by Tenant to an Affiliate provided that (i)the Affiliate has a tangible net worth at least equal to that of Tenant as of the date of this Lease, (ii) Tenant provides Landlord notice of the Transfer at least 15 days prior to the effective date, together with current financial statements of the Affiliate certified by an executive officer of the Affiliate, and (iii) in the case of an assignment or sublease, Tenant delivers to Landlord an assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to Landlord executed by Tenant and the Affiliate, together with a certificate of insurance evidencing the Affiliates compliance with the insurance requirements of Tenant under this Lease.
**********************
(c)The provisions of subsection(a) above notwithstanding, if Tenant proposes to Transfer all of the Premises (other than to an Affiliate), Landlord may terminate this Lease, either conditioned on execution of a new lease between Landlord and the proposed transferee or without that condition.If Tenant proposes to enter into a Transfer of less than all of the Premises (other than to an Affiliate), Landlord may amend this Lease to remove the portion of the Premises to be transferred, either conditioned on execution of a new lease between Landlord and the proposed transferee or without that condition.If this Lease is not so terminated or amended, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, immediately upon receipt, the excess of (i)all compensation received by Tenant for the Transfer over (ii)the Rent allocable to the Premises transferred.
**********************
(d)If Tenant requests Landlords consent to a Transfer, Tenant shall provide Landlord, at least 15 days prior to the proposed Transfer, current financial statements of the transferee certified by an executive officer of the transferee, a complete copy of the proposed Transfer documents, and any other information Landlord reasonably requests.Immediately following any approved assignment or sublease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an assumption agreement reasonably acceptable to Landlord executed by Tenant and the transferee, together with a certificate of insurance evidencing the transferees compliance with the insurance requirements of Tenant under this Lease.Tenant agrees to reimburse Landlord for reasonable administrative and attorneys fees in connection with the processing and documentation of any Transfer for which Landlords consent is requested.
**********************
19.Subordination; Mortgagees Rights.
**********************
(a)Tenant accepts this Lease subject and subordinate to any Mortgage now or in the future affecting the Premises, provided that Tenants right of possession of the Premises shall not be disturbed by the Mortgagee so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease.This clause shall be self-operative, but within 10 days after request, Tenant shall execute and deliver any further instruments confirming the subordination of this Lease and any further instruments of attornment that the Mortgagee may reasonably request.However, any Mortgagee may at any time subordinate its Mortgage to this Lease, without Tenants consent, by giving notice to Tenant, and this Lease shall then be deemed prior to such Mortgage without regard to their respective dates of execution and delivery; provided that such subordination shall not affect any Mortgagees rights with respect to condemnation awards, casualty insurance proceeds, intervening liens or any right which shall arise between the recording of such Mortgage and the execution of this Lease.
**********************
(b)No Mortgagee shall be (i) liable for any act or omission of a prior landlord, (ii) subject to any rental offsets or defenses against a prior landlord, (iii) bound by any amendment of this Lease made without its written consent, or (iv) bound by payment of Monthly Rent more than one month in advance or liable for any other funds paid by Tenant to Landlord unless such funds actually have been transferred to the Mortgagee by Landlord.
**********************
(c)The provisions of Sections 15 and 16 above notwithstanding, Landlords obligation to restore the Premises after a casualty or condemnation shall be subject to the consent and prior rights of any Mortgagee.
**********************
20.Tenants Certificate; Financial Information.

(a)On the date on which this Lease expires or terminates, Tenant shall return possession of the Premises to Landlord in good condition, except for ordinary wear and tear, and except for casualty damage or other conditions that Tenant is not required to remedy under this Lease.Prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenant shall remove from the Property all furniture, trade fixtures, equipment, wiring and cabling (unless Landlord directs Tenant otherwise), and all other personal property installed by Tenant or its assignees or subtenants.Tenant shall repair any damage resulting from such removal and shall restore the Property to good order and condition.Any of Tenants personal property not removed as required shall be deemed abandoned, and Landlord, at Tenants expense, may remove, store, sell or otherwise dispose of such property in such manner as Landlord may see fit and/or Landlord may retain such property or sale proceeds as its property.If Tenant does not return possession of the Premises to Landlord in the condition required under this Lease, Tenant shall pay Landlord all resulting damages Landlord may suffer.
**********************
(b)If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the expiration or termination of this Lease, Tenants occupancy of the Premises shall be that of a tenancy at will.Tenants occupancy during any holdover period shall otherwise be subject to the provisions of this Lease (unless clearly inapplicable), except that the Monthly Rent shall be double the Monthly Rent payable for the last full month immediately preceding the holdover.No holdover or payment by Tenant after the expiration or termination of this Lease shall operate to extend the Term or prevent Landlord from immediate recovery of possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise.Any provision in this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, any holdover by Tenant shall constitute a default on the part of Tenant under this Lease entitling Landlord to exercise, without obligation to provide Tenant any notice or cure period, all of the remedies available to Landlord in the event of a Tenant default, and Tenant shall be liable for all damages, including consequential damages, that Landlord suffers as a result of the holdover.
