Each Guaranteeing Entity expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations under the Financing Documents, and all notices of acceptance of the

**********************
(l)Pursuant to Section10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities that are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent conveyance laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under Article10 of the Indenture, this new Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations of such Guaranteeing Entity under this Guarantee will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
**********************
(m)This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Issuer for liquidation, reorganization, should the Issuer become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Issuers assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Notes are, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee
**********************
on the Notes and Guarantee, whether as a voidable preference, fraudulent transfer or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made.
In the event that any payment or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Note shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
**********************
(n)In case any provision of this Guarantee shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
**********************
(o)This Guarantee shall be a general unsecured senior obligation of such Guaranteeing Entity, ranking pari passu with any other future senior Indebtedness of such Guaranteeing Entity, if any.
**********************
(p)Each payment to be made by any Guaranteeing Entity in respect of this Guarantee shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any kind or nature.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantors consent to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of any Guaranteeing Entity under this Supplemental Indenture or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guaranteeing Entity.
