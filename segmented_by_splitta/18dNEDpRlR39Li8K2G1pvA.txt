The Company shall advance , to the extent not expressly prohibited by law , the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding , and such advancement shall be made within five days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements requesting such advances ( which shall include invoices received by Indemnitee in connection with such Expenses but , in the case of invoices in connection with legal services , any references to legal work performed or to expenditures made that would cause Indemnitee to waive any privilege accorded by law shall not be included with the invoice ) from time to time , whether prior to or after final disposition of any Proceeding.
Advances shall be unsecured and interest free.
Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitees ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitees ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Deed.
Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement , an action to enforce Indemnitees rights generally under this Deed and any application under Section 391 , including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the advances claimed.
The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Deed which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to the extent required by law to repay the advance of Expenses if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment , not subject to appeal , or other competent authority or arbitrator that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.
Indemnitee further undertakes to repay any amounts paid by the Company for indemnification hereunder if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment , not subject to appeal , or other competent authority or arbitrator that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.
This Section 7 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 6 following the ultimate determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment , not subject to appeal , or other competent authority or arbitrator.
The right to advances under this paragraph shall in all events continue until final disposition of any Proceeding , including any appeal therein.
For the avoidance of doubt , the provisions of Section 9 shall not apply to advancement of Expenses as contemplated by this Section 7.

     8. Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim.

           ( a )  To obtain indemnification under this Deed ( including , without limitation , with respect to advancement of Expenses or other costs or expenses , including attorneys fees and disbursements , for which indemnity is permitted hereby ) , Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor.

           ( b )  The Company will be entitled to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.

     9. Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification.

           ( a )  The Company shall promptly provide the indemnification rights and undertake related obligations contemplated by this Deed.
If the Company concludes , on written advice of counsel , that a determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification , in the specific case , is required by law , then the Company shall immediately notify Indemnitee in writing.
Promptly thereafter , the board of directors of the Company or , if requested by Indemnitee within 10 days after receipt of such written notice , Independent Counsel shall make a determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification.
If such determination is made by Independent Counsel , it shall be in a written statement to the board of directors of the Company , a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.
If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification , payment to Indemnitee shall be made within five days after such statement is delivered.
Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Independent Counsel making such determination with respect to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification ,

4

 

including providing to such counsel upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
Any costs or expenses ( including attorneys fees and disbursements ) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Independent Counsel shall be borne by the Company ( irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitees entitlement to indemnification ) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

           ( b )  The Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee and notified in writing to the Company.
The Company may , within three days after written notice of such selection , deliver to the Indemnitee a written objection to such selection ; provided , however , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of Independent Counsel as defined in Section 2 , and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion.
Absent a proper and timely objection , the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel.
If such written objection is so made and substantiated , the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit.
If , within 10 days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8 ( a ) , and the final disposition of the Proceeding , including any appeal therein , no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to , the Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company to the selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate , and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 9 ( a ) .
Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 11 ( a ) , Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity ( subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing ) .

     10. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.

           ( a )  In making a determination with respect to such entitlement to indemnification hereunder , the Independent Counsel making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Deed if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 8 ( a ) , and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Independent Counsel of any determination contrary to that presumption.
Neither the failure of the Company or of Independent Counsel to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Deed that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met any applicable standard of conduct , nor an actual determination by the Company or by Independent Counsel that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct , shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

           ( b )  The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim , issue or matter therein , by judgment , order , settlement or conviction , or upon a plea of guilty , nolo contendere or its equivalent , shall not ( except as otherwise expressly provided in this Deed ) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act honestly and reasonably and that Indemnitee ought fairly to be excused for the negligence , default , breach of duty or breach of trust.

           ( c )  For purposes of any determination of honesty and reasonableness , Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted honestly and reasonably if Indemnitees action or inaction is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise , including financial statements , or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties , or on the advice of legal

5

 

counsel for the Enterprise or the board of directors of the Company or counsel selected by any committee of the board of directors of the Company or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser , investment banker or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or the board of directors of the Company or any committee of the board of directors of the Company.
The provisions of this Section 10 ( c ) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Deed.

           ( d )  The knowledge and/or actions , or failure to act , of any director , secretary , officer , executive , employee or agent of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Deed.

     11. Remedies of Indemnitee.

           ( a )  Subject to Section 11 ( e ) , in the event that ( i )  a determination is made pursuant to Section 9 that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Deed , ( ii ) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 7 , ( iii )  no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 9 ( a ) within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification , ( iv )  payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the last sentence of Section 9 ( a ) within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor , or ( v )  payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3 or 7 is not made within five days after a determination has been delivered to the Board of Directors of the Company that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification , Indemnitee shall be entitled to apply to court for an adjudication of his entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses.
Alternatively , Indemnitee , at his option , may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 11 ( a ) ; provided , however , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 4.
The Company shall not oppose Indemnitees right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.

           ( b )  In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 9 ( a ) that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification , any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial , or arbitration , on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination.
In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 , the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses , as the case may be.

           ( c )  If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 9 ( a ) that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification , the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 , absent ( i )  a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact , or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitees statement not materially misleading , in connection with the request for indemnification , or ( ii )  an express prohibition of such indemnification under law.

           ( d )  The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 11 that the procedures and presumptions of this Deed are not valid , binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Deed.
It is the intent of the Company that the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation ,

6

 

enforcement or defense of Indemnitees rights under this Deed by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder.
The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and , if requested by Indemnitee , shall ( within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor ) advance , to the extent not expressly prohibited by law , such Expenses to Indemnitee , which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Deed or under any directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company if , in the case of indemnification , Indemnitee is wholly successful on the underlying claims and if Indemnitee is not wholly successful on the underlying claims , then such indemnification shall be only to the extent Indemnitee is successful on such underlying claims or otherwise as permitted by law , whichever is greater.

           ( e )  Notwithstanding anything in this Deed to the contrary , no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Deed shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding , including any appeal therein.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder , or otherwise , shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Deed to indemnification for some or a portion of Expenses or other costs or expenses , including attorneys fees and disbursements , but not , however , for the total amount thereof , Indemnitee shall nevertheless be indemnified for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.
