All references to a particular Person shall be construed so as to include their respective successors and permitted assigns. The word “including” shall be deemed to mean “including but not limited to” and the word “or” has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase “and/or.” The words “hereof,” “herein,” “hereunder” and similar terms in this Guaranty refer to this Guaranty as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Guaranty. The section headings contained in this Guaranty and the table of contents preceding this Guaranty are for reference purposes only and shall not control or affect the construction of this Guaranty or the interpretation thereof in any respect. Article, section, subsection, exhibit and schedule references are to this Guaranty unless otherwise specified.

Section 2.    Guaranty. In consideration of, and as an inducement for Owner to enter into the Bareboat Charter and for the Lenders to enter into the Loan Agreement, Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the prompt performance and payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise (but past any applicable grace or cure period), of the obligations of TPS (a) to pay (x) Basic Charter Hire and (y) Supplemental Hire in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Time Charter (including, without limitation, the obligation therein to make such payments when due directly to the Owner), and (b) to perform its obligations under the Time Charter (the foregoing collectively called, the “Guaranteed Obligations”). Owner, each Lender and each Agent are referred to herein, collectively, as the “Guaranteed Parties” and each individually is a “Guaranteed Party.” This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely a guaranty of collection.
Section 3.    Waiver. Guarantor hereby waives: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, and of the creation or existence of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and of any action by a Guaranteed Party in reliance hereon or in connection herewith; (b) presentment, demand for payment, notice of dishonor or nonpayment, protest and notice of protest with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; and (c) any requirement that suit be brought against, or any other action by a Guaranteed Party be taken against, or any notice of default or other notice be given to, or any demand be made on, TPS or any other person, or that any other action be taken or not taken as a


condition to Guarantor's liability for the Guaranteed Obligations under this Guaranty or as a condition to the enforcement of this Guaranty against Guarantor.
Section 4.    Guaranty Absolute. The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of: (a) any change in the time, manner, terms, place of payment, or in any other term of all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other document executed in connection therewith, to which TPS has agreed; (b) any sale, exchange, release, or non-perfection of any property standing as security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or any release, amendment, waiver, or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) failure, omission, delay, waiver, or refusal by Savage Harvest or any Guaranteed Party to exercise, in whole or in part, any right or remedy held by Savage Harvest under the Time Charter or by any Guaranteed Party with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (d) any change in the existence, structure, or ownership of Guarantor or TPS, any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding of Savage Harvest, Demise Owner Parent, TPS, Guarantor or Savage Companies, or any change in the existence, structure or ownership of Guarantor or TPS; (e) any re-characterization of the Bareboat Charter from that of a financing and/or the Time Charter from that of a financial and service contract; (f) any determination or finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Bareboat Charter is unenforceable or ineffective; (g) any default, breach or rejection of the Time Charter or Bareboat Charter by Savage Harvest, Demise Owner Parent, TPS or any trustee thereof; and (h) any subchartering of the Vessel by the Time Charterer under the Time Charter. This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by a Guaranteed Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of TPS, or any other guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that all amounts payable by Guarantor hereunder are payable on a hell or high water basis, and no payments made by Guarantor shall be subject to any abatement, reduction, adjustment, right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or defense due to any present or future claims of Guarantor against Owner, the Lenders, Administrative Agent, or Collateral Agent, under this Guaranty or otherwise, or against Owner, the Lenders, Administrative Agent, or Collateral Agent under any Principal Document or otherwise, nor shall Guarantor be entitled to retain any interest in or with respect to amounts paid hereunder, which have already been paid, or assert any right to any refund or adjustment in the event of a termination of this Guaranty or otherwise.
Section 5.    Guaranty Irrevocable. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty of payment and performance, and not merely of collectability, and shall remain in full force and effect, and may not be revoked by Guarantor, until all indebtedness and liabilities of TPS and Guarantor under the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full, in good and indefeasible funds or are otherwise satisfied in full.
Section 6.    Limitations. Guarantor’s liability hereunder shall be limited to the payment and performance of TPS’s obligations under the Time Charter and any payments or performance required to be made by Guarantor hereunder (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, or any other damages, except to the extent specifically provided in the Time Charter to be due from the Time Charterer or herein to be due from Guarantor. If any withholding


or other taxes (other than income taxes on the net income of the Owner or Lenders arising out of such payment) are at any time imposed on any payments under or in respect of this Guaranty including, but not limited to, payments made pursuant to this paragraph, Guarantor shall pay all such taxes to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and it is acknowledged that such amounts are part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
