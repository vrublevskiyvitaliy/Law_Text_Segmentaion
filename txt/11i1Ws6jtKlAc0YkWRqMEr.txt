Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated of even date herewith (the “SPA”), pursuant to which the Holder is acquiring this Note.



The following is a statement of the rights of the Holder of this Note and the terms and conditions to which this Note is subject, and to which the Holder, by acceptance of this Note, agrees:



1.           Series.  This Note is one of a series of Notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of a minimum of Nine Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,300,000) and up to a maximum of Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000.00) (collectively, the “Notes”) as described in that certain Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated December 10, 2009, delivered to the Holder in connection with the transactions contemplated by the SPA (the “Memorandum”). 



2.           Principal Repayment.  The outstanding principal amount of this Note shall be payable on the Maturity Date, unless this Note has been earlier converted as described below.





 





 



3.           Interest.



(a)           Computation.  Interest (the “Interest”) shall accrue on the unpaid principal amount of this Note from the date hereof until such principal amount is repaid in full at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31) commencing January 1, 2010.  For purposes of clarity, the initial interest payment shall consist of accrued interest from the date of issuance of the Note through December 31, 2009.  Thereafter, interest payments of accrued interest shall be due and payable on the last day of each fiscal quarter until the Maturity Date, subject to earlier conversion or redemption of the Note. All computations of the interest rate hereunder shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.   In the event that any interest rate provided for herein shall be determined to be unlawful, such interest rate shall be computed at the highest rate permitted by applicable law.  Any payment by the Company of any interest amount in excess of that permitted by law shall be considered a mistake, with the excess being applied to the principal of this Note without prepayment premium or penalty.



(b)           Closing Escrow Holdback.  Pursuant to the SPA, $186,000 (if the Minimum Amount is raised) or up to $240,000 (if the Maximum Amount is raised) (the “Total Holdback Amount”), constituting an amount sufficient to satisfy one quarterly payment of Interest due on the aggregate principal amount of all Notes, shall be retained by the Escrow Agent and paid to the holders of the Notes and otherwise administered in accordance with the certain Closing Escrow Agreement.  At such time as 75% of all Shares underlying the Notes have been issued upon conversion of Notes, if the Company is not in breach of any of the Transaction Documents, all remaining funds of the Total Holdback Amount, if any, shall be disbursed to the Company in accordance with the Closing Escrow Agreement.



4.           Ranking.   Except for the indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence on the date hereof as described in the Memorandum (including the financial statements that form a part thereof), and subject to the terms and conditions of this Note and the other Transaction Documents, the obligations of the Company under this Note shall rank senior with respect to all existing indebtedness of the Company as of the date hereof and to any and all indebtedness incurred hereafter. The term “indebtedness” as used in this Section 4, refers to all unsecured debts and obligations of the Company, including trade payables.  



5.           Conversion.



(a)           Generally.  Each holder of the Notes shall have the right, exercisable at any time prior to the Maturity Date, to convert all, but not less than all, of the principal amount then outstanding, plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock) at a conversion price (the “Conversion Price”) equal to $2.00 per share (the Common Stock underlying the Notes being referred to herein as the “Shares”).

(c)           Adjustments to Conversion Price.



(i)           Adjustments for Stock Splits and Combinations and Stock Dividends.  If the Company shall at any time or from time to time after the date hereof, effect a stock split or combination of the outstanding Common Stock or pay a stock dividend in shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price shall be proportionately adjusted. Any adjustments under this Section 5(c)(i) shall be effective at the close of business on the date the stock split or combination becomes effective or the date of payment of the stock dividend, as applicable.



(ii)           Merger Sale, Reclassification, etc. In case of any (A) consolidation or merger (including a merger in which the Company is the surviving entity), (B) sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or distribution of property to shareholders (other than distributions payable out of earnings or retained earnings), or reclassification, change or conversion of the outstanding securities of the Company or of any reorganization of the Company (or any other corporation the stock or securities of which are at the time receivable upon the conversion of this Note) or any similar corporate reorganization on or after the date hereof, then and in each such case the Holder of this Note, upon the conversion hereof at any time thereafter shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the stock or other securities and property receivable upon the conversion hereof prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or other disposition, reclassification, change, conversion or reorganization, the stock or other securities or property to which such Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such Holder had converted this Note immediately prior thereto.

(1)           the numerator of which shall be equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock plus (y) the number of shares of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) which the aggregate consideration for the total number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at a price per share equal to the Conversion Price then in effect, and



(2)           the denominator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock.



(B)           The provisions of paragraph (A) of Section 5(iii) shall not apply to any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock for which an adjustment is provided elsewhere in this Section 5).  No adjustment of the number of Shares for which this Note shall be convertible shall be made under this clause (iii) upon the issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the exercise of any Common Stock Equivalents, if any such adjustment shall previously have been made upon the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 5.



(C)           Issuance of Common Stock Equivalents.  The provisions of this Section 5(iii) shall apply if (a) the Company, at any time after the issuance date of this Note, shall issue any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”), other than the Convertible Notes, or (b) any rights or warrants or options to purchase any such Common Stock or Convertible Securities (collectively, the “Common Stock Equivalents”) shall be issued or sold.  If the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock may be issuable pursuant to any such Common Stock Equivalent shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price then in effect, or if, after any such issuance of Common Stock Equivalents, the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock may be issuable thereafter is amended or adjusted, and such price as so amended shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then the applicable Conversion Price upon each such issuance or amendment shall be adjusted as provided in the first sentence of subsection (iii)(A) of this Section 5.  No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Security or Common Stock Equivalent where an adjustment to the Conversion Price was made as a result of the issuance or purchase of any Convertible Security or Common Stock Equivalent.
