GRANT OF RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS

Section 2.1 — Grant of the Restricted Share Units

     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the additional terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement including any country-specific provisions set forth in Schedule B to this Agreement, the Company hereby grants Restricted Share Units (hereinafter called “RSUs”) to the Associate, over a number of Shares as stated in Schedule A to this Agreement. In circumstances where the Associate is required to enter into the Agreement of Restrictive Covenants and Other Obligations set forth in Schedule C, the Associate agrees that the grant of RSUs pursuant to this Agreement is sufficient consideration for the Associate entering into such agreement.

Section 2.2 — Employment Rights

     Subject to the terms of the Agreement of Restrictive Covenants and Other Obligations, where applicable, the rights and obligations of the Associate under the terms of his office or employment with the Company or any Subsidiary shall not be affected by his participation in this Plan or any right which he may have to participate in it. The RSUs and the Associate’s participation in the Plan will not be interpreted to form an employment agreement with the Company. The Associate hereby waives any and all rights to compensation or damages in consequence of the termination of his office or employment for any reason whatsoever insofar as those rights arise or may arise from his ceasing to have rights under or be entitled to vest his RSUs as a result of such termination. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Associate shall be deemed irrevocable to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims.

Section 2.3 — Adjustments in RSUs Pursuant to Merger, Consolidation, etc.

     Subject to Section 9 of the Plan, in the event that the outstanding Shares subject to a RSU are, from time to time, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of Shares or other securities, by reason of a share split, spin-off, shares or extraordinary cash dividend, share combination or reclassification, recapitalization, merger, Change of Control (as defined in the Plan), or similar event, the Committee shall in its absolute discretion, make an appropriate and equitable adjustment in the number and kind of Shares. Notwithstanding Section 10 of the Plan, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan), and regardless of whether the RSUs

4





 





are assumed or substituted by a successor company, the RSUs shall not immediately vest unless the Committee so determines at the time of the Change of Control, in its absolute discretion, on such terms and conditions that the Committee deems appropriate. Any such adjustment or determination made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Associate, the Company and all other interested persons. For the avoidance of doubt, a transaction shall not constitute a Change of Control (i) if effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation or form of organization of the ultimate parent entity of the Willis group of companies (including where the Company is succeeded by an issuer incorporated under the laws of another state, country or foreign government for such purpose and whether or not the Company remains in existence following such transaction) and (ii) where all or substantially all of the Person(s) who are the beneficial owners of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such transaction will beneficially own, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the ultimate parent entity resulting from such transaction in substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such transaction, of such outstanding securities of the Company. The Board, in its sole discretion, may make an appropriate and equitable adjustment to the Shares underlying the RSUs to take into account such transaction, including to substitute or provide for the issuance of shares of the resulting ultimate parent entity in lieu of Shares of the Company.

Section 2.4 — Employee Costs

     The Associate must make full payment to the Company or any Subsidiary by which the Associate is employed (the “Employer”) of all income tax, payroll tax, payment on account, and social insurance contribution amounts (“Tax”), which under federal, state, local or foreign law, it is required to withhold upon vesting or other tax event of the RSUs. In a case where the Employer is obliged to (or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any Tax (in any jurisdiction) for which the Associate is liable by virtue of the Associate’s participation in the Plan or any social security contributions recoverable from and legally applicable to the Associate (the “Tax-Related Items”), the Associate shall make full payment to the Employer of an amount equal to the Tax-Related Items, or otherwise enter into arrangements acceptable to the Employer or another Subsidiary to secure that such a payment is made (whether by withholding from the Associate’s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Associate or from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at vesting of the RSUs).

     In the event that the Associate has not made payment of an amount equal to the Tax-Related Items liability, or entered into arrangements to secure that such a payment is made by the date of vesting or shortly thereafter as agreed by the Company, the Associate hereby authorizes and empowers the Company to act on his behalf and procure and effect the sale of a sufficient number of the Shares arising from the RSUs to vest and pay out of the sale proceeds the Tax-Related Items liability to the Employer.
