     (iii) except as hereinafter provided, shall, at the option of the Bermuda Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into one or more Borrowings of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, provided that (A) except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 1.10(b), all Tranche C Term Loans made as part of the same Borrowing shall at all times consist of Tranche C Term Loans of the same Type and (B) unless the Administrative Agent has determined that the Syndication Date has occurred (at which time this clause (B) shall no longer be applicable), no more than four Borrowings of Tranche C Term Loans to be maintained as Eurodollar Loans may be incurred prior to the 30th day after the Restatement Effective Date (or, if later, the last day of the Interest Period applicable to the fourth Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans referred to below), each of which Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans may only have an Interest Period of one week, and the first of which Borrowings may be made no earlier than the third Business Day, and no later than the fifth Business Day, after the Restatement Effective Date, the second of which Borrowings may only be made on the last day of the Interest Period of the first such Borrowing, the third of which Borrowings may only be made on the last day of the Interest Period of the second such Borrowing and the fourth of which Borrowings may only be made on the last day of the Interest Period of the third such Borrowing; and

     (iv) shall not exceed for any Lender, in initial principal amount, that amount which equals the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of its Converted Tranche C Term Loan (if any) made as provided in clause (b)(I) above (and as set forth opposite its name on Schedule I hereto under the heading “Converted Tranche C Term Loans”) plus (y) the Tranche C Term Loan Commitment of such Lender (if any) as in effect on the Restatement Effective Date (before giving effect to any reductions thereto on such date pursuant to Section 3.03(c)).

In connection with the Term Loan Conversion and the incurrence of Additional Tranche C Term Loans pursuant to this Section 1.01(b), (i) the Interest Period applicable to each Borrowing of Original Tranche B Term Loans, subject to conversion pursuant to this Section 1.01(b), existing on the Restatement Effective Date (immediately prior to the Term Loan Conversion) and maintained as Eurodollar Loans under the Original Credit Agreement shall, simultaneously with the occurrence of the Term Loan Conversion, be broken, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall (and is hereby authorized to) take all appropriate actions to ensure that all Lenders with outstanding Tranche C Term Loans (after giving effect to the Term Loan Conversion and the incurrence of Additional Tranche C Term Loans pursuant to this Section 1.01(b)) participate in each new Borrowing of Tranche C Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon their respective Tranche C Term Loan Borrowing Amounts as in effect on the Restatement Effective Date) and (iii) the Bermuda Borrower shall be obligated to pay to the respective Original Lenders breakage and/or other costs of the type referred to in Section 1.11 of the Original Credit Agreement (if any) incurred in connection with the Term Loan Conversion and/or the actions taken pursuant to pre-

ceding clause (ii) of this Section 1.01(b). Once repaid, Tranche C Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

          (c) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender with an Incremental Term Loan Commitment for a given Tranche of Incremental Term Loans severally agrees, at any time and from time to time on and after the date that such Incremental Term Loan Commitment is obtained pursuant to Section 1.15 and prior to the Incremental Term Loan Commitment Termination Date for such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans, to make a term loan (each, an “Incremental Term Loan” and, collectively, the “Incremental Term Loans”) to the Incremental Term Loan Borrower for such Tranche, which Incremental Term Loans:

     (i) shall be incurred on an Incremental Term Loan Borrowing Date for the purposes described in Section 7.05(a);

     (ii) shall be denominated in Dollars;

     (iii) except as hereinafter provided, shall, at the option of the Incremental Term Loan Borrower for such Tranche, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into one or more Borrowings of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, provided that except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 1.10(b), all Incremental Term Loans of a given Tranche made as part of the same Borrowing shall at all times consist of Incremental Term Loans of the same Type; and

     (iv) shall not exceed for any such Incremental Term Loan Lender at any time of any incurrence thereof, the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Loan Lender for such Tranche at such time (before giving effect to any reductions thereto on such date pursuant to Section 3.03(e)).

Once repaid, Incremental Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

          1.02 Minimum Borrowing Amounts, etc. The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing of Loans shall not be less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable to Borrowings of the respective Type and Tranche of Loans to be made or maintained pursuant to the respective Borrowing. More than one Borrowing may be incurred on any day, but at no time shall there be outstanding more than 35 Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans.

          1.03 Notice of Borrowing. Whenever a Borrower desires to make a Borrowing of Loans hereunder, an Authorized Officer of such Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office at least one Business Day’s prior written (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) notice of each Base Rate Loan and at least three Business Days’ prior written (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) notice of each Eurodollar Loan to be made hereunder, provided that any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a certain day only if given before 2:00 P.M. (New York time) on such day. Each such written notice or written confirmation of telephonic notice (each, a “Notice of Borrowing”), except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.10, shall be irrevocable and shall be given by or on behalf of the respective Borrower in the form of Exhibit A-1, appropriately completed to specify: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the respective Borrowing shall

-4-





 





consist of Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans, U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans or Bermuda Borrower Incremental Term Loans and (iv) whether the Loans being made pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially maintained as Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender which is required to make Loans of the Tranche specified in the respective Notice of Borrowing notice of such proposed Borrowing, of such Lender’s proportionate share thereof (determined in accordance with Section 1.07) and of the other matters required by the immediately preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of Borrowing.

          1.04 Disbursement of Funds. Not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, each Lender with a Commitment under the respective Tranche, will make available its pro rata portion (determined in accordance with Section 1.07) of each such Borrowing requested to be made on such date (or, in the case of Additional Tranche C Term Loans, each Lender with a Tranche C Term Loan Commitment will make available an amount thereof equal to its Tranche C Term Loan Commitment on the Restatement Effective Date (prior to the termination thereof pursuant to Section 3.03(c) on such date)). All such amounts shall be made available in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Payment Office of the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent will make available to the respective Borrower the Payment Office or such other location as may be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and specified in the relevant Notice of Borrowing the aggregate of the amounts so made available by the Lenders prior to 3:00 P.M. (New York time) on such day to the extent of funds actually received by the Administrative Agent prior to such time on such day. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s portion of any Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower to pay immediately such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent and such Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover on demand from such Lender or the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the respective Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if recovered from such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate and (ii) if recovered from the respective Borrower, the rate of interest applicable to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant to Section 1.08. Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the relevant Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by such Lender to make Loans hereunder.

          1.05 Notes. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.05(f), the U.S. Borrower’s (in the case of Tranche B Term Loans and U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans) and the

          (e) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of each Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any transfer of any of its Notes endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation or any error in any such notation or endorsement shall not affect either Borrower’s obligations in respect of any Loans.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to Lenders that at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to either Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the respective Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the various Credit Documents. Any Lender that does not have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to make the notations or endorsements otherwise described in preceding clause (e). At any time when any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence any of its Loans, the relevant Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the requested Note or Notes in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

          1.06 Conversions. Each Borrower shall have the option to convert, on any Business Day occurring after the Restatement Effective Date, all or a portion equal to at least the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount (and, if greater, in an integral multiple of $500,000) of the outstanding principal amount of Loans made to such Borrower pursuant to one or more Borrowings of one or more Types of Loans under a single Tranche into a Borrowing or Borrowings of another Type of Loan under such Tranche, provided that (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.10(b) or unless the respective Borrower pays all amounts owing pursuant to Section

-7-





 





1.11 concurrently with any such conversion, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable to the Eurodollar Loans being converted and no such partial conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of such Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the applicable Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, (ii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, Base Rate Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of conversion, (iii) unless the Administrative Agent has determined that the Syndication Date has occurred (at which time this clause (iii) shall no longer be applicable), prior to the 30th day after the Restatement Effective Date, conversions of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans may only be made if any such conversion is effective on the first day of the first, second, third or fourth Interest Period referred to in clause (B) of the provisos appearing in each of Section 1.01(a)(iii) and Section 1.01(b)(iii) and so long as any such conversion does not result in a greater number of Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans prior to the 30th day after the Restatement Effective Date as are permitted under Section 1.01(a)(iii) and Section 1.01(b)(iii), and (iv) no conversion pursuant to this Section 1.06 shall result in a greater number of Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans than is permitted under Section 1.02. Each such conversion shall be effected by the applicable Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office prior to 2:00 P.M. (New York time) at least three Business Days’ prior notice (each, a “Notice of Conversion/Continuation”) in the form of Exhibit A-2, appropriately completed to specify the Loans of such Borrower to be so converted, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were made and, if to be converted into Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto.

          1.07 Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings of Tranche B Term Loans, Tranche C Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans of a given Tranche under this Agreement shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of such Lenders’ Tranche B Term Loan Commitments, Tranche C Term Loan Borrowing Amounts or Incremental Term Loan Commitments of the applicable given Tranche, as the case may be. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.

          1.08 Interest. (a) The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees to pay (in the case of Tranche B Term Loans and U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans, in each case maintained as Base Rate Loans) and the Bermuda Borrower hereby agrees to pay (in the case of Tranche C Term Loans and Bermuda Borrower Incremental Term Loans, in each case maintained as Base Rate Loans) interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan made to it from the date of the Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Base Rate Loan and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan pursuant to Section 1.06, at a rate per annum which shall be equal to the sum of the Base Rate in effect from time to time during the period such Base Rate Loan is outstanding plus the relevant Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time.

          (b) The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees to pay (in the case of Tranche B Term Loans and U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans, in each case maintained as Eurodollar Loans) and the Bermuda Borrower hereby agrees to pay (in the case of Tranche C Term Loans

-8-





 





and Bermuda Borrower Incremental Term Loans, in each case maintained as Eurodollar Loans), interest in respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan made to it from the date of the Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Eurodollar Loan and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 1.06, 1.09 or 1.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the relevant Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time.

          (c) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable hereunder shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) 2% per annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans maintained pursuant to the respective Tranche (or, if the overdue amount owing does not relate to any specific Tranche, the rate otherwise applicable to Tranche B Term Loans which are maintained as Base Rate Loans) from time to time and (y) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then borne by such Loans, in each case with such interest to be payable on demand.

          (d) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date, (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period and (iii) in respect of each Loan, on any repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

          (e) Upon each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for the respective Interest Period or Interest Periods and shall promptly notify the respective Borrower and the respective Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

          1.09 Interest Periods. At the time a Borrower gives any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of the making of, or conversion into, any Eurodollar Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the respective Borrower shall have the right to elect, by having an Authorized Officer of such Borrower give the Administrative Agent notice thereof, the interest period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of such Borrower (but otherwise subject to (x) clause (B) of the proviso appearing in Section 1.01(a)(iii), (y) clause (B) of the proviso appearing in Section 1.01(b)(iii) and (z) clause (iii) of the proviso appearing in Section 1.06) be, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, a one, two, three or six-month period or, to the extent agreed to by all Lenders required to make Loans under the respective Tranche, a nine or twelve-month period (or, if required by clause (B) of the proviso appearing in either Section 1.01(a)(iii) or Section 1.01(b)(iii), a one-week period); provided that:

     (i) all Eurodollar Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall at all times have the same Interest Period;

-9-





 





     (ii) the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan shall commence on the date of Borrowing of such Eurodollar Loan (including the date of any conversion thereto from a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Eurodollar Loan shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto expires;

     (iii) if any Interest Period relating to a Eurodollar Loan begins on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of such calendar month;

     (iv) if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

     (v) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing under a given Tranche of Loans shall be selected which extends beyond the respective Maturity Date for such Tranche of Loans;

     (vi) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan may be selected at any time when a Default or Event of Default is then in existence; and

     (vii) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of any Tranche of Term Loans shall be elected which extends beyond any date upon which a Scheduled Repayment for the respective Tranche of Term Loans will be required to be made under Section 4.02(b) if, after giving effect to the election of such Interest Period, the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche of Term Loans which have Interest Periods which will expire after such date will be in excess of the aggregate principal amount of such Tranche of Term Loans then outstanding less the aggregate amount of such required Scheduled Repayment.

If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as applicable, has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans, in any such case effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest Period.

          1.10 Increased Costs; Illegality; etc. (a) In the event that any Lender shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

     (i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes arising after the Restatement Effective Date affecting the applicable interbank market, adequate

-10-





 





and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of the Eurodollar Rate; or

     (ii) at any time that such Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to any Eurodollar Loan because of (x) any change since the Restatement Effective Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for example, but not limited to (A) a change in the basis of taxation of payments to a Lender of the principal of or interest on the Loans or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such Lender imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located) or (B) a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar Rate and/or (y) other circumstances arising since the Restatement Effective Date affecting such Lender, the interbank market or the position of such Lender in such market (whether or not such Lender was a Lender at the time of such occurrence); or

     (iii) at any time after the Restatement Effective Date, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar Loan has been made unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or order (or would conflict with any governmental rule, regulation, guideline, request or order not having the force of law but with which such Lender customarily complies even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Restatement Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the applicable interbank market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in writing) to the affected Borrower, and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies any affected Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by either Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by such Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, the respective Borrower or Borrowers, as the case may be, agrees to pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (with the written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, submitted to the respective Borrower or Borrowers by such Lender in accordance with the foregoing to be, absent manifest error, final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any of the respective Borrower’s or Borrowers’ obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(a)

-11-





 





upon the subsequent submission of such notice) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the respective Borrower or Borrowers shall take one of the actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees that if it gives notice to either Borrower of any of the events described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, it shall promptly notify such Borrower and, in the case of any such Lender, the Administrative Agent, if such event ceases to exist.

          (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the affected Borrower may (and, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(iii), shall) either (x) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel the respective Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the same date that such Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), as the case may be, or (y) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days’ written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan (which conversion, in the case of the circumstance described in Section 1.10(a)(iii), shall occur no later than the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan or such earlier day as shall be required by applicable law).

          (c) If any Lender shall have determined after the Restatement Effective Date that the adoption or effectiveness after the Restatement Effective Date of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change after the Restatement Effective Date in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such other controlling Person’s capital or assets as a consequence of such Lender’s Commitment or Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such other controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such other controlling Person’s policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon written demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), accompanied by the notice referred to in the next succeeding sentence of this Section 1.10(c), the Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such other controlling Person for such reduction in the rate of return to such Lender or such other controlling Person. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the relevant Borrower (a copy of which shall be sent by such Lender to the Administrative Agent), which notice shall set forth such Lender’s basis for asserting its rights under this Section 1.10(c) and the calculation, in reasonable detail, of such additional amounts claimed hereunder, although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish either Borrower’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice. A Lender’s good faith determination of compensation owing under this Section 1.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto.

-12-





 





          (d) In the event that any Lender shall in good faith determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto) at any time that such Lender is required to maintain reserves (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserves required by applicable law) which have been established by any Federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental agency, authority, instrumentality or regulatory body with jurisdiction over such Lender (including any branch, Affiliate or funding office thereof) in respect of any Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit, any Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties or any category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on any Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit or any Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of any Lender to non-United States residents, then, unless such reserves are included in the calculation of the interest rate applicable to such Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit or such Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty or in Section 1.10(a)(ii), such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers in writing specifying the additional amounts required to indemnify such Lender against the cost of maintaining such reserves (such written notice to provide in reasonable detail a computation of such additional amounts) and the Borrowers jointly and severally agree to pay to such Lender such specified amounts as additional fees at the time that either Borrower is otherwise required to pay regularly accruing fees in respect of such Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit or such Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty or, if later, on written demand therefor by such Lender.

          1.11 Compensation. (a) The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding any loss of anticipated profit) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or any Agent) a Borrowing of, or conversion from or into, Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation (whether or not withdrawn by the respective Borrower or Borrowers or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section 1.10(a)); (ii) if any repayment (including any repayment made pursuant to Section 4.01 or 4.02 or as a result of an acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 10 or as a result of the replacement of a Lender pursuant to Section 1.13, 4.01 or 13.12(b)), conversion or permitted “realignment” of any of its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the respective Borrower or Borrowers; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the respective Borrower to repay its Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b). Each Lender’s calculation of the amount of compensation owing pursuant to this Section 1.11(a) shall be made in good faith. A Lender’s basis for requesting compensation pursuant to this Section 1.11(a) and a Lender’s calculation of the amount thereof, shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

          (b) The Borrowers jointly and severally agree to compensate the Deposit Bank and each CL Lender, upon the Deposit Bank’s or applicable CL Lender’s written request

-13-





 





(which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and liabilities incurred by the Deposit Bank or such CL Lender in connection with: (i) any withdrawals from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period or Scheduled Investment Termination Date for the Credit-Linked Deposits; and (ii) the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment (and the related termination of the investment of the funds held in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account) prior to the end of any applicable Interest Period or Scheduled Investment Termination Date for the Credit-Linked Deposits; provided, however, that neither of the Borrowers shall have any obligation to compensate the Deposit Bank or any CL Lender pursuant to this Section 1.11(b) for any losses, expenses and liabilities in connection with periods after such Interest Period or Scheduled Investment Termination Date, as the case may be.

          1.12 Change of Lending Office. (a) Each Lender may at any time or from time to time designate, by written notice to the Administrative Agent to the extent not already reflected on Schedule II, one or more lending offices (which, for this purpose, may include Affiliates of the respective Lender) for the various Loans made, and Letters of Credit and Bank Guaranties participated in, by such Lender (including, without limitation, by designating a separate lending office (or Affiliate) to act as such with respect to Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit Outstandings and Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty Outstandings versus Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit Outstandings and Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty Outstandings); provided that, for designations made after the Restatement Effective Date (unless such designation is made after the occurrence of a Sharing Event as a result of any Lender’s purchase of participating interests in Loans, Letters of Credit, Unpaid Drawings, Unreimbursed Payments and Credit-Linked Deposits pursuant to Section 1.14), to the extent such designation shall result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 2A.06, 2B.06 or 4.04 in excess of those which would be charged in the absence of the designation of a different lending office (including a different Affiliate of the respective Lender), then the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay such excess increased costs (although if such designation results in increased costs, the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the costs which would have applied in the absence of such designation and any subsequent increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective designation). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, such lending office and Affiliate of any Lender designated as provided above shall, for all purposes of this Agreement, be treated in the same manner as the respective Lender (and shall be entitled to all indemnities and similar provisions in respect of its acting as such hereunder).

          (b) Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2A.06, Section 2B.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the applicable Borrower by notice to such Lender, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans, Letters of Credit and/or Bank Guaranties, as the case may be, affected by such event, provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of any of the aforementioned Sections. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of either Borrower or the rights of any Lender provided in Sections 1.10, 2A.06, 2B.06 and 4.04.

-14-





 





          1.13 Replacement of Lenders. (x) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, (y) upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c) or (d), Section 2A.06, Section 2B.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to either Borrower increased costs materially in excess of the average costs being charged by the other Lenders in respect of such contingency or (z) in the case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this Agreement which has been approved by the Required Lenders as provided in Section 13.12(b), the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, shall have the right, in accordance with the requirements of Section 13.04(b), if no Event of Default then exists or would exist after giving effect to such replacement, to replace such Lender (the “Replaced Lender”) with one or more Eligible Transferees (collectively, the “Replacement Lender”), none of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement and each of whom shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent or, in the case of a replacement as provided in Section 13.12(b) where the consent of the respective Lender is required with respect to less than all Tranches of its Loans or Commitments, at the option of the applicable Borrower, to replace only the Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of such Lender in respect of each Tranche where the consent of such Lender would otherwise be individually required, with identical Commitments and/or Loans of the respective Tranche provided by the Replacement Lender; provided that:

     (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section 13.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the Commitments and all then outstanding Loans (or, in the case of the replacement of less than all the Tranches of Commitments and outstanding Loans of the respective Replaced Lender, all the Commitments and/or all then outstanding Loans relating to the Tranche or Tranches with respect to which such Lender is being replaced) of, and all participations in all then outstanding Letters of Credit and Bank Guaranties issued pursuant to the respective Tranche or Tranches where the respective Lender is being replaced by, the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum (in the relevant currency or currencies) of (A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all then outstanding Loans of the respective Replaced Lender under each Tranche with respect to which such Replaced Lender is being replaced, (B) an amount equal to the then remaining Credit-Linked Deposit of such Lenders (if any) at such time, (C) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings (if any) under each Tranche with respect to which the respective Replaced Lender is being replaced, in each case that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender (including by way of application of such Lender’s Credit-Linked Deposit) at such time, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time, (D) an amount equal to all Unreimbursed Payments (if any) under each Tranche with respect to which the respective Replaced Lender is being replaced, in each case that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender (including by way of application of such Lender’s Credit-Linked Deposit) at such time, together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time, and (E) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender (but only with re-

spect to the relevant Tranche or Tranches, in the case of the replacement of less than all Tranches then held by the respective Replaced Lender) pursuant to Section 3.01; and

     (ii) all obligations of the Borrowers owing to the Replaced Lender in respect of each Tranche where such Replaced Lender is being replaced (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement.

Upon the execution of the respective Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, recordation of the assignment on the Register by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.17 and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender (when applicable) pursuant to Section 1.05(f), delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the respective Borrower, (x) the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and, unless the respective Replaced Lender continues to have outstanding Loans or any Commitment hereunder, the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2A.06, 2B.06, 4.04, 13.01 and 13.06), which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender and (y) in the case of the replacement of any Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to this Section 1.13, the CL Percentages of the CL Lenders shall be automatically adjusted at such time to give effect to such replacement. The Credit-Linked Deposit funded by any CL Lender shall not be released in connection with any assignment of its Credit-Linked Commitment, but shall instead be purchased by the relevant assignee (at par, as described in clause (i)(B) of the proviso above) and continue to be held by the Deposit Bank for application (if not already applied) pursuant to Sections 2A.04 and 2B.04 in respect of such assignee’s obligations under the Credit-Linked Commitment assigned to it.

          1.14 Special Provisions Applicable to Lenders Upon the Occurrence of a Sharing Event. (a) On the date of the occurrence of any Sharing Event, or promptly thereafter, (i) if there have been any Drawings pursuant to Letters of Credit which have not yet been reimbursed to the respective Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2A, the respective Issuing Lender shall seek reimbursement therefor as permitted pursuant to Section 2A.04(c) and (ii) if there have been any Bank Guaranty Payments pursuant to Bank Guaranties which have not yet been reimbursed to the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer pursuant to Section 2B, the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer shall seek reimbursement therefor as permitted pursuant to Section 2B.04(c)). After giving effect to the actions taken (or required to be taken) pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall request that the Deposit Bank return (in which case the Deposit Bank shall return) to the Administrative Agent who shall, in turn, return to the CL Lenders amounts (if any) representing Credit-Linked Deposits which are permitted to be returned to the CL Lenders at such time in accordance with Section 2C.04(a) hereof.

          (b) (i) Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, but after giving effect to the actions required to be taken pursuant to preceding clause (a) of this Section 1.14 (although any failure by the Administrative Agent, the Deposit Bank or any Lender to take the actions required of it pursuant to said clause shall not prevent the actions required hereby, but the respective Administrative Agent, Deposit Bank or Lender shall continue to be obligated to perform its obligations as required above and the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to make any equitable

-16-





 





adjustments as may be deemed necessary or desirable pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.14(b)), the Lenders shall purchase participations from other Lenders in each of the respective Tranches of Loans and the CL Tranche (including, in the case of the CL Tranche, participations in each outstanding Letter of Credit, each Unpaid Drawing owing to the CL Lenders, each outstanding Bank Guaranty, each Unreimbursed Payment owing to the CL Lenders and the Credit-Linked Deposits of the various CL Lenders) so that, after giving effect to such purchases, each Lender shall have the same credit exposure in each Tranche at such time (including, (x) in the case of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment, an interest in each outstanding Letter of Credit, each Unpaid Drawing owing to the CL Lenders, each outstanding Bank Guaranty, each Unreimbursed Payment owing to the CL Lenders and the Credit-Linked Deposits of the various CL Lenders and (y) a participation in the Credit-Linked Deposits established pursuant to Section 2C.01 and all amounts deposited in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account from time to time or to be returned to the Lenders in accordance with the provisions of Section 2), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender’s Exchange Percentage thereof.

          (ii) The foregoing actions pursuant to immediately preceding clause (i) shall be accomplished pursuant to this Section 1.14(b) through purchases and sales of participations in the various Tranches as required hereby, and at the request of the Administrative Agent each Lender hereby agrees to enter into customary participation agreements approved by the Administrative Agent to evidence same. All purchases and sales of participations pursuant to this Section 1.14(b) shall be made in Dollars. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that, pursuant to this Section 1.14(b), the various CL Lenders may be selling participations to the other Lenders in their Credit-Linked Deposits (after giving effect to the actions required on, or promptly following, the occurrence of the Sharing Event pursuant to Section 1.14(a)), and in connection therewith each CL Lender shall be paid, in immediately available funds in Dollars, amounts equal to the percentage participations sold by them in their Credit-Linked Deposits, which immediately available funds shall be paid by the Lenders acquiring participations therein. At the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender which has sold participations in any of its Tranches as provided above (through the Administrative Agent) will deliver to each Lender (through the Administrative Agent) which has so purchased a participation therein a participation certificate in the appropriate amount as determined in conjunction with the Administrative Agent. It is understood that the amount of immediately available funds delivered by each Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various Lenders as required above.

          (c) In the event that any Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit or any Bank Guaranty as provided in Section 1.14(b), each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting Lender (and not against the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender, any Bank Guaranty Issuer, the Deposit Bank or any other Lender) for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default.

          (d) All determinations by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 1.14 shall be made by it in accordance with the provisions herein and with the intent being to equitably share the credit risk for all Tranches (and the Credit-Linked Deposits) hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof. Absent manifest error, all determinations by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be binding on the Borrowers, each of the Lenders, each Issuing

-17-





 





Lender, each Bank Guaranty Issuer and the Deposit Bank. The Administrative Agent shall have no liability to either Borrower, any Lender, any Issuing Bank, any Bank Guaranty Issuer or the Deposit Bank for any determinations made by it hereunder except to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          (e) Upon, and after, the occurrence of a Sharing Event (i) no further Credit Events shall be made or occur, and (ii) all Credit-Linked Commitments and all Incremental Term Loan Commitments (if any) shall be automatically terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any Lender to purchase its participating interests as required above in any extensions of credit (and/or any Credit-Linked Deposits) upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other Lender on any date.

          (f) If any amount required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to this Section 1.14 is not paid to the Administrative Agent on the date upon which the Sharing Event occurred, such Lender shall, in addition to such aforementioned amount, also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such Lender for the purchase of its participations, (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Rate, during the period from and including the date of request for payment to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent and (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts payable under this Section 1.14 shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Amounts payable by any Lender pursuant to this Section 1.14 shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders, provided that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to fund on behalf of such other Lender the amounts owing to such other Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.

          (g) Whenever, at any time after the relevant Lenders have received from any other Lenders purchases of participations pursuant to this Section 1.14, the various Lenders receive any payment on account thereof, such Lenders will distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the various Lenders participating therein, such Lenders’ participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding) in like funds as received, provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by any Lenders is required to be returned, the Lenders who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective Lenders any portion thereof previously so distributed to them in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by the respective Lenders.

          (h) Each Lender’s obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section 1.14 shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any other Lender, any Credit Agreement Party or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of any Default or

-18-





 





Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of any Credit Agreement Party or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Credit Document by any Credit Agreement Party, any Lender, any Issuing Lender, any Bank Guaranty Issuer, any Agent, the Deposit Bank or any other Person, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

          (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, upon any purchase of participations as required above, (i) the relevant Borrower shall pay to each Lender granting any participations as required above, for the account of the respective Lender which has purchased such participations, any increased costs and indemnities (including, without limitation, pursuant to Sections 1.11, 1.12, 2A.06, 2B.06 and 4.04) to the same extent as if such Lender which has purchased such participations were the direct Lender as opposed to a participant therein, which increased costs shall be calculated without regard to Section 1.13, Section 13.04(a) or the penultimate sentence of Section 13.04(b) and (ii) each Lender which has sold such participations shall be entitled to receive from the relevant Borrower indemnification from and against any and all taxes imposed as a result of the sale of the participations pursuant to this Section 1.14. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and after giving effect to the requirements of this Section 1.14, increased Taxes may be owing by it pursuant to Section 4.04, which Taxes shall be paid (to the extent provided in Section 4.04) by the respective Borrower or Borrowers, without any claim that the increased Taxes are not payable because same resulted from the participations effected as otherwise required by this Section 1.14.

          1.15 Incremental Term Loan Commitments. (a) So long as the Incremental Term Loan Commitment Request Requirements are satisfied at the time of the delivery of the request referred to below, each Borrower shall have the right, in consultation and coordination with the Administrative Agent as to all of the matters set forth below in this Section 1.15, but without requiring the consent of any of the Lenders, to request, at any time and from time to time after the Restatement Effective Date and prior to the date which is 12 months prior to the then latest Maturity Date, that one or more Lenders (and/or one or more other Persons which are Eligible Transferees and which will become Lenders) provide Incremental Term Loan Commitments to such Borrower and, subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and in the respective Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement, make Incremental Term Loans pursuant thereto; it being understood and agreed, however, that (i) no Lender shall be obligated to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment as a result of any such request by such Borrower, and until such time, if any, as such Lender has agreed in its sole discretion to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment and executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement as provided in clause (b) of this Section 1.15 such Lender shall not be obligated to fund any Incremental Term Loans, (ii) any Lender (including any Eligible Transferee who will become a Lender) may so provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment without the consent of any other Lender, (iii) each Tranche of Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall be made available to a single Incremental Term Loan Borrower and shall be denominated in Dollars, (iv) the amount of each Tranche of Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall be in a minimum aggregate amount for all Lenders which provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment under such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans (including Eligible Transferees who will become Lenders) of at least $25,000,000, (v) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term Loan Commitments provided pursuant to this Section 1.15

-19-





 





shall not exceed the Maximum Incremental Term Loan Commitment Amount (it being understood and agreed, however, to the extent that any such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are obtained but later expire, terminate or are voluntarily reduced in each case without being utilized, the amount of such Incremental Term Loan Commitments so expired, terminated or voluntarily reduced may again be available to be obtained under this Section 1.15 within the limits set forth herein), (vi) the up-front fees and, if applicable, any unutilized commitment fees and/or other fees, payable in respect of each Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall be separately agreed to by the respective Incremental Term Loan Borrower and each Incremental Term Loan Lender (and with all such fees to be disclosed in writing by the respective Incremental Term Loan Borrower to the Administrative Agent), (vii) each Tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall have (I) (x) an Incremental Term Loan Maturity Date of no earlier than the then latest Maturity Date as then in effect, and (y) a Weighted Average Life to Maturity of no less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity as then in effect for the Tranche of then outstanding Loans with the longest Weighted Average Life to Maturity and (II) an “interest rate” or “interest rates” applicable to such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans (which, for such purposes only, shall be determined by the Administrative Agent and deemed to include all upfront or similar fees or original issue discount (amortized over the life of such Incremental Term Loans) payable to all Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans, but exclusive of any arrangement, structuring or other fees payable in connection therewith that are not shared with all Lenders providing such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans) that may (at such time or from time to time thereafter) exceed the “interest rates” applicable to the Term Loans provided that, in the event that the “interest rate” excess applicable to such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall at such time be greater than 0.50% (or its equivalent), the Applicable Margin for the Tranche B Term Loans, the Tranche C Term Loans and each other then existing Tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall be increased by such amounts, and for such time periods, as are needed so that at no time shall the “interest rate” for the respective new Tranche of Incremental Term Loans (calculated as described above) exceed the relevant interest rates applicable to the then existing Tranches of Term Loans by more than 0.50%; provided further, that, at no time shall the provisions of this Section 1.15 be construed to result in any decrease in any interest rate applicable to any then existing Tranche of Term Loans (including after giving effect to any prior increases in interest rates applicable thereto pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 1.15), (viii) the proceeds of all Incremental Term Loans shall be used only for the purposes permitted by Section 7.05(a), (ix) each Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement shall specifically designate, with the approval of the Administrative Agent, the Tranche of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments being provided thereunder (which Tranche shall be a new Tranche (i.e., not the same as any existing Tranche of Incremental Term Loans, Incremental Term Loan Commitments or other Term Loans) unless the requirements of Section 1.15(c) are satisfied), (x) all Incremental Term Loans (and all interest, fees and other amounts payable thereon) shall be Obligations under this Agreement and the other applicable Credit Documents and shall be secured by the relevant Security Documents, and guaranteed under each relevant Guaranty, on a pari passu basis with all other Loans of the applicable Borrower secured by each such Security Agreement and guaranteed under each such Guaranty, and (xi) each Lender (including any Eligible Transferee who will become a Lender) agreeing to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment pursuant to an Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement shall, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant conditions set forth in this Agreement, make Incremental Term Loans under the Tranche specified in such Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement as provided in Section 1.01(c) and

-20-





 





such Loans shall thereafter be deemed to be Incremental Term Loans under such Tranche for all purposes of this Agreement and the other applicable Credit Documents.

          (b) At the time of the provision of Incremental Term Loan Commitments pursuant to this Section 1.15, the respective Incremental Term Loan Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each such Lender or other Eligible Transferee which agrees to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment (each, an “Incremental Term Loan Lender”) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit P (appropriately completed), with the effectiveness of the Incremental Term Loan Commitment provided therein to occur on the date set forth in such Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement, which date in any event shall be no earlier than the date on which (w) all fees required to be paid in connection therewith at the time of such effectiveness shall have been paid (including, without limitation, any agreed upon up-front or arrangement fees owing to the Administrative Agent), (x) all Incremental Term Loan Commitment Requirements are satisfied, (y) all other conditions set forth in this Section 1.15 shall have been satisfied, and (z) all other conditions precedent that may be set forth in such Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement shall have been satisfied. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement, and at such time, (i) Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised Incremental Term Loan Commitments of the affected Lenders and (ii) to the extent requested by any Incremental Term Loan Lender, Incremental Term Notes will be issued at the respective Incremental Term Loan Borrower’s expense, to such Incremental Term Loan Lender, to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05(d) (with appropriate modification) to the extent needed to reflect the new Incremental Term Loans made by such Incremental Term Loan Lender.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this Section 1.15, the Incremental Term Loan Commitments provided by an Incremental Term Loan Lender or Incremental Term Loan Lenders, as the case may be, pursuant to each Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement shall constitute a new Tranche, which shall be separate and distinct from the existing Tranches pursuant to this Agreement (with a designation which may be made in letters (i.e., A, B, C, etc.), numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) or a combination thereof (i.e., A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2, etc.), provided that, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, the parties to a given Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement may specify therein that the respective Incremental Term Loans made pursuant thereto shall constitute part of, and be added to, an existing Tranche of Incremental Term Loans or to the outstanding Tranche of Tranche B Term Loans or Tranche C Term Loans, in either case so long as the following requirements are satisfied:

     (i) the Incremental Term Loans to be made pursuant to such Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement shall have the same Borrower, shall have the same Maturity Date and shall have the same Applicable Margin as the Tranche of Term Loans to which the new Incremental Term Loans are being added;

     (ii) the new Incremental Term Loans shall have the same Scheduled Repayment dates as then remain with respect to the Tranche to which such new Incremental Term Loans are being added (with the amount of each Scheduled Repayment applicable to such new Incremental Term Loans to be the same (on a proportionate basis) as is theretofore applicable to the Tranche to which such new Incremental Term Loans are being

-21-





 





added, thereby increasing the amount of each then remaining Scheduled Repayment of the respective Tranche proportionately); and

     (iii) on the date of the making of such new Incremental Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 1.09, such new Incremental Term Loans shall be added to (and form part of) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of the respective Tranche on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of the various outstanding Borrowings), so that each Lender will participate proportionately in each then outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of the respective Tranche.

To the extent the provisions of preceding clause (iii) require that Lenders making new Incremental Term Loans add such Incremental Term Loans to the then outstanding Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans of such Tranche, it is acknowledged that the effect thereof may result in such new Incremental Term Loans having short Interest Periods (i.e., an Interest Period that began during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding Eurodollar Loans of such Tranche and which will end on the last day of such Interest Period). In connection therewith, the respective Incremental Term Loan Borrower may agree, in the respective Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement, to compensate the Lenders making the new Incremental Term Loans of the respective Tranche for funding Eurodollar Loans during an existing Interest Period on such basis as may be agreed by such Incremental Term Loan Borrower and the respective Incremental Term Loan Lender or Incremental Term Loan Lenders.

     (i) any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Restatement Effective Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in effect or known to such Issuing Lender as of the Restatement Effective Date and which such Issuing Lender in good faith deems material to it; or

     (ii) such Issuing Lender, prior to the issuance of such Letter of Credit, shall have received written notice from any Credit Agreement Party or the Required Lenders of the type described in clause (iv) of Section 2A.01(c) or the last sentence of Section 2A.03(b).

-23-





 





Maturity Date and (y) each Trade Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate on or before the date occurring not later than 180 days after such Trade Letter of Credit’s date of issuance, (iii) (x) no Standby Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date occurring later than the fifth Business Day preceding the CL Maturity Date and (y) no Trade Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date occurring later than 30 days prior to the CL Maturity Date and (iv) no Issuing Lender will issue any Letter of Credit after it has received written notice from any Credit Agreement Party or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an Event of Default exists until such time as such Issuing Lender shall have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from the party or parties originally delivering the same or (y) a waiver of such Default or Event of Default by the Required Lenders.

          (d) Part A of Schedule XI hereto contains a description of certain letters of credit issued (or deemed issued) pursuant to the Original Credit Agreement and outstanding on the Restatement Effective Date (and setting forth, with respect to each such letter of credit, (i) the name of the issuing lender, (ii) the letter of credit number, (iii) the name(s) of the account party or account parties, (iv) the stated amount (including the currency in which such letter of credit is denominated, which shall be Dollars or an Alternative Currency), (v) the name of the beneficiary, (vi) the expiry date and (vii) whether such letter of credit constitutes a standby letter of credit or a trade letter of credit). Each such letter of credit, including any extension or renewal thereof (each, as amended from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof, an “Existing Letter of Credit”) shall constitute a “Letter of Credit” and a “Bermuda Borrower Letter of Credit” or a “U.S. Borrower Letter of Credit” (as set forth on Part A of Schedule XI) for all purposes of this Agreement and issued, for purposes of Section 2A.04(a), on the Restatement Effective Date. Any Lender hereunder (and any of such Lender’s Affiliates and/or branches) which has issued an Existing Letter of Credit shall constitute an “Issuing Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement.

          2A.02 Minimum Stated Amount. The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit upon issuance shall be not less than (x) in the case of a Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit, $250,000, (y) in the case of a Euro Denominated Letter of Credit, €150,000 and (z) in the case of a Sterling Denominated Letter of Credit, £150,000, or in each case such lesser amount as is reasonably acceptable to the respective Issuing Lender.

          2A.03 Letter of Credit Requests. (a) Whenever an Account Party desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, such Account Party shall give the Administrative Agent (at the appropriate Notice Office) and the respective Issuing Lender at least 3 Business Days’ (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such Issuing Lender in any given case) written notice prior to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day). Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C-1 (each, a “Letter of Credit Request”), including, without limitation, by specifying: (i) whether the requested Letter of Credit shall constitute a U.S. Borrower Letter of Credit or a Bermuda Borrower Letter of Credit; and (ii) the currency in which the requested Letter of Credit is to be denominated (which shall be Dollars or, to the extent permitted hereunder, an Alternative Currency. Each Letter of Credit Request shall include any other documents as such Issuing Lender customarily requires in connection therewith.

          (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the applicable Account Party that such Letter of Credit may be is-

-24-





 





sued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 2A.01(c). Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received notice from the Required Lenders before it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 6, as the case may be, are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate Section 2A.01(c), then such Issuing Lender may issue the requested Letter of Credit for the account of the respective Account Party in accordance with such Issuing Lender’s usual and customary practices.

          2A.04 Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the issuance by any Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, but subject to Section 2C.03 to the extent applicable in the case of Non-Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each CL Lender (each such Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit, in its capacity under this Section 2A.04, a “L/C Participant”), and each such L/C Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (each an “L/C Participation”), in a percentage equal to such L/C Participant’s CL Percentage in such Letter of Credit, and each Drawing made thereunder and the obligations of the respective Account Party under this Agreement with respect thereto (although CL Facility Fees shall be payable directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the CL Lenders as provided in Section 3.01(a) and the L/C Participants shall have no right to receive any portion of any Facing Fees or any administration fees with respect to any such Letters of Credit) and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Credit-Linked Commitments and, as a result thereof, the CL Percentages of the CL Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13, or 13.04, it is hereby agreed that with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings relating thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 2A.04 to reflect the new CL Percentages of the CL Lenders. With respect to each Letter of Credit from time to time outstanding, all calculations of the percentage participations therein of the various CL Lenders shall be made from time to time by the Administrative Agent, which calculations shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and as more fully set forth in Section 1.14, additional sub-participations may be required to be granted by the various CL Lenders in their participations in outstanding Letters of Credit, in each case in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, Section 1.14.

          (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, the respective Issuing Lender shall have no obligation relative to the other Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision), shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting liability to any Account Party or any Lender.

          (c) In the event that any Issuing Lender makes any payment or disbursement under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the respective Account Party shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2A.05(a) by the date required by said Section 2A.05(a) for such reimbursement, such Issuing Lender shall promptly no-

-25-





 





tify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each L/C Participant therein and the Deposit Bank of such failure, and each CL Lender (including in its capacity as an L/C Participant) hereby irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank (and the Deposit Bank hereby agrees) to reimburse such Issuing Lender for such amount in Dollars (or, to the extent that the respective Unpaid Drawing is in an Alternative Currency, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof, as determined by the Administrative Agent on the date on which such payment or disbursement was made under the respective Letter of Credit) solely from such CL Lender’s CL Percentage of the Credit-Linked Deposits on deposit with the Deposit Bank in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, in which case the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be reduced by the amount so applied (with a corresponding reduction in the Credit-Linked Commitment of each CL Lender equal to such CL Lender’s CL Percentage of such aggregate amount so applied); provided that any portion of the Unpaid Drawings with respect to a Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit, which, because of currency fluctuations, represents amounts in excess of the Total Credit-Linked Deposits (as more fully described in Section 2C.03), shall not be reimbursed from Credit-Linked Deposits but shall instead be immediately repaid by the respective Account Party. Furthermore, if any Specified Default or any Event of Default then exists, the respective Issuing Lender may, with respect to any payment or disbursement made by it under any Letter of Credit, request the Deposit Bank, in which case each CL Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank (and the Deposit Bank hereby agrees), to reimburse the Issuing Lender, solely from such CL Lender’s CL Percentage of the Credit-Linked Deposits on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account with the Deposit Bank, for any Drawing under such Letter of Credit as provided in the immediately preceding sentence (notwithstanding the date of reimbursement of any such Drawings by the date required by Section 2A.05(a)), in which case the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be reduced by the amount so applied as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence, and any amounts actually received pursuant to Section 2A.05(a) shall be applied to reimburse L/C Participants as provided in following Section 2A.04(d).

          (d) Whenever any Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Issuing Lender any payments from the L/C Participants (or from the Deposit Bank on their behalf) pursuant to Section 2A.04(c) above, such Issuing Lender shall, after paying itself any amounts owing to it as described in Section 2C.03 in the case of payments received with respect to Non-Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit, pay (in same day funds in Dollars) to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay (in same day funds in Dollars) to each L/C Participant which has paid its relevant CL Percentage thereof) an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s share (based on the proportionate aggregate amount funded by such L/C Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all L/C Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

          (e) Each Issuing Lender shall, promptly after the issuance of, or amendment or modification to, a Standby Letter of Credit, give the Administrative Agent and the respective Account Party written notice of such issuance, amendment or modification, as the case may be, and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Standby Letter of Credit, such amendment or such modification, as the case may be. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each L/C Participant, in writing, of such issuance, amendment or modification and if any L/C Participant shall so request, the Administrative Agent shall furnish

-26-





 





said L/C Participant with a copy of such Standby Letter of Credit, such amendment or such modification, as the case may be.

          (f) Each Issuing Lender (other than DBAG) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Deposit Bank, promptly on the first Business Day of each week, by facsimile transmission, the aggregate daily Stated Amount available to be drawn under the outstanding Trade Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for the previous week.

          (g) The obligations of the L/C Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Credit Documents;

     (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender, any L/C Participant, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

     (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

     (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

     (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;

provided that the L/C Participants shall not be obligated to reimburse such Issuing Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of deliberate acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting liability to the L/C Participants or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          2A.05 Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees (in the case of U.S Borrower Letters of Credit), and the Bermuda Borrower hereby

-27-





 





agrees (in the case of Bermuda Borrower Letters of Credit) to reimburse the respective Issuing Lender, by making payment in Dollars (or, if the respective Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the respective payment or disbursement, as determined by the Administrative Agent on the date of such payment or disbursement) to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Payment Office (or by making the payment directly to such Issuing Lender at such location as may otherwise have been agreed upon by the respective Account Party and such Issuing Lender), for any payment or disbursement (in the case of any such payment or disbursement under any Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit, taking the Dollar Equivalent, as determined by the Administrative Agent, of the amount of the respective payment or disbursement on the date upon which the respective payment or disbursement is made) made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it (each such amount so paid until reimbursed, an “Unpaid Drawing”), not later than the third Business Day after the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender notifies the respective Account Party of such payment or disbursement (provided that no such notice shall be required to be given if a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case all such Unpaid Drawings shall be due and payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of which are hereby waived by the respective Account Party)), with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time), on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing Lender is reimbursed by the respective Account Party therefor at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin for Tranche B Term Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time; provided, however, to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day following the receipt by the Account Party of notice to the respective Account Party by the Administrative Agent or the respective Issuing Lender of such payment or disbursement (or, if sooner, from the date of occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05), interest shall thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender (and until reimbursed by the respective Account Party) at a rate per annum which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to the respective Unpaid Drawing as provided above, with all such interest payable pursuant to this Section 2A.05 to be payable on demand. The respective Issuing Lender shall give the respective Account Party prompt notice of each Drawing under any Letter of Credit, provided that the failure to give, or any delay in giving, any such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the respective Account Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The obligations of the respective Account Party to repay Unpaid Drawings as required above shall not be reduced, or satisfied, in any respect by payments made to the Issuing Lender with any amounts on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or as otherwise provided in Section 2A.04(c).

          (b) The obligations of the U.S. Borrower (with respect to U.S. Borrower Letters of Credit) and the obligations of the Bermuda Borrower (with respect to Bermuda Borrower Letters of Credit) under this Section 2A.05 to reimburse the respective Issuing Lender with respect to Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the respective Account Party may have or have had against any Lender (including in its capacity as Issuing Lender or as L/C Participant), including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit (each, a “Drawing”) to

-28-





 





conform to the terms of such Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing, the respective Issuing Lender’s only obligation to the respective Account Party being to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with requirements of such Letter of Credit; provided, however, that no Account Party shall be obligated to reimburse any Issuing Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a result of deliberate acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit shall not create for such Issuing Lender any resulting liability to any Account Party unless such action is taken or admitted to be taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          2A.06 Increased Costs. If after the Restatement Effective Date, the Deposit Bank, any Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant determines in good faith that the adoption or effectiveness after the Restatement Effective Date of any applicable law, rule or regulation, order, guideline or request or any change therein, or any change after the Restatement Effective Date in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant’s participation therein, or (ii) impose on the Deposit Bank, any Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant any other conditions directly or indirectly affecting this Agreement, the Credit-Linked Deposits, any Letter of Credit or such L/C Participant’s participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in the Credit-Linked Deposits or any Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant hereunder or under the other Credit Documents or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect to Credit-Linked Deposits or Letters of Credit, then, upon written demand to the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, by the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant (a copy of which notice shall be sent by the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), accompanied by the certificate described in the last sentence of this Section 2A.06, the respective Account Party shall pay to the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate submitted to the relevant Borrower by the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Deposit Bank, such Issuing Lender or such L/C Participant as aforesaid shall be final and conclusive and binding on such Account Party absent manifest error, although the failure to deliver any such certificate shall not release or diminish such Account Party’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2A.06 upon subsequent receipt of such certificate.

     (i) any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Bank Guaranty Issuer from issuing such Bank Guaranty or any requirement of law applicable to such Bank Guaranty Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental authority with jurisdiction over such Bank Guaranty Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such Bank Guaranty Issuer refrain from, the issuance of bank guaranties generally or such Bank Guaranty in particular or shall impose upon such Bank Guaranty Issuer with respect to such Bank Guaranty any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such Bank Guaranty Issuer is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the Restatement Effective Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not appli-

Each such bank guaranty, including any extension or renewal thereof (each, as amended from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof, an “Existing Bank Guaranty”), shall constitute either a “Bermuda Borrower Bank Guaranty” or a “U.S. Borrower Bank Guaranty” (as set forth on Part B of Schedule XI) for all purposes of this Agreement and issued, for purposes of Section 2B.04(a), on the Restatement Effective Date. Any Lender hereunder (and any of such Lender’s Affiliates and/or branches) which has issued an Existing Bank Guaranty shall constitute a “Bank Guaranty Issuer” for all purposes of this Agreement.

          2B.02 Minimum Face Amount. The Face Amount of each Bank Guaranty upon issuance shall be not less than (x) in the case of a Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty, $250,000,

-31-





 





(y) in the case of a Euro Denominated Bank Guaranty, €150,000 and (z) in the case of a Sterling Denominated Bank Guaranty, £150,000, or in each case such lesser amount as is acceptable to the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer.

          2B.03 Bank Guaranty Requests. (a) Whenever an Account Party desires that a Bank Guaranty be issued for its account, such Account Party shall give the Administrative Agent (at the appropriate Notice Office) and the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer at least 3 Business Days’ (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such Bank Guaranty Issuer in any given case) written notice prior to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business Day). Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C-2 (each, a “Bank Guaranty Request”), including, without limitation, whether the requested Bank Guaranty shall constitute a U.S. Borrower Bank Guaranty or a Bermuda Borrower Bank Guaranty and, by specifying the Available Currency in which the requested Bank Guaranty is to be denominated. Each Bank Guaranty Request shall include any other documents as such Bank Guaranty Issuer customarily requires in connection therewith.

          (b) The making of each Bank Guaranty Request shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, that such Bank Guaranty may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements of, Section 2B.01(c). Unless the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer has received notice from the Required Lenders before it issues a Bank Guaranty that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 6, as the case may be, are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Bank Guaranty would violate Section 2B.01(c), then such Bank Guaranty Issuer may issue the requested Bank Guaranty for the account of the respective Account Party in accordance with such Bank Guaranty Issuer’s usual and customary practices.

          2B.04 Bank Guaranty Participations. (a) Immediately upon the issuance by any Bank Guaranty Issuer of any Bank Guaranty, but subject to Section 2C.03 to the extent applicable in the case of Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties, such Bank Guaranty Issuer shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each CL Lender (each such Lender with respect to any Bank Guaranty, in its capacity under this Section 2B.04, a “B/G Participant”), and each such B/G Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Bank Guaranty Issuer, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (each a “B/G Participation”), in a percentage equal to such B/G Participant’s CL Percentage in such Bank Guaranty, each Bank Guaranty Payment made thereunder and the obligations of the respective Account Party under this Agreement with respect thereto (although CL Facility Fees shall be payable directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the CL Lenders as provided in Section 3.01(a) and the B/G Participants shall have no right to receive any portion of any Fronting Fees or any administration fees with respect to any such Bank Guaranties) and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Credit-Linked Commitments and, as a result thereof the CL Percentages, of the CL Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04, it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Bank Guaranties and Unreimbursed Payments relating thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 2B.04 to reflect the new CL Percentages of the CL Lenders. With respect to each Bank Guaranty from time to time outstanding, all calculations of the percentage participations therein of the various CL Lenders shall be made from time to time by the Administrative Agent, which calculations shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and as more fully set forth in Section 1.14, additional sub-

-32-





 





participations may be required to be granted by the various CL Lenders in their participations in outstanding Bank Guaranties, in each case in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, Section 1.14.

          (b) In determining whether to pay under any Bank Guaranty, the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer shall have no obligation relative to the other Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Bank Guaranty appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Bank Guaranty. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Bank Guaranty Issuer under or in connection with any Bank Guaranty issued by it if taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision), shall not create for such Bank Guaranty Issuer any resulting liability to the respective Account Party or any Lender.

          (c) In the event that any Bank Guaranty Issuer makes any payment or disbursement under any Bank Guaranty issued by it and the respective Account Party shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to such Bank Guaranty Issuer pursuant to Section 2B.05(a) by the date required by said Section 2B.05(a) for such reimbursement, such Bank Guaranty Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each B/G Participant therein and the Deposit Bank of such failure, and each CL Lender (including in its capacity as a B/G Participant) hereby irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank (and the Deposit Bank hereby agrees) to reimburse such Bank Guaranty Issuer for such amount in Dollars (or, to the extent that the respective Unreimbursed Payment is in an Alternative Currency, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof, as determined by the Administrative Agent on the date on which such payment or disbursement was made under the respective Bank Guaranty) solely from such B/G Participant’s CL Percentage of the Credit-Linked Deposits on deposit with the Deposit Bank in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, in which case the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be reduced by the amount so applied (with a corresponding reduction in the Credit-Linked Commitment of each CL Lender equal to such CL Lender’s CL Percentage of such aggregate amount so applied); provided that any portion of the Unreimbursed Payments with respect to a Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty which, because of currency fluctuations, represents amounts in excess of the Total Credit-Linked Deposits, as more fully described in Section 2C.03, shall not be reimbursed from Credit-Linked Deposits but shall instead be immediately repaid by the respective Account Party. Furthermore, if any Specified Default or any Event of Default then exists, the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer may, with respect to any payment or disbursement made by it under any Bank Guaranty, request of the Deposit Bank, in which case each CL Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Deposit Bank (and the Deposit Bank hereby agrees), to reimburse the Bank Guaranty, solely from such CL Lender’s CL Percentage of the Credit-Linked Deposits on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account with the Deposit Bank for any Bank Guaranty Payment made by such Bank Guaranty Issuer under such Bank Guaranty, as provided in the immediately preceding sentence (notwithstanding the date of reimbursement of any such Bank Guaranty Payment by the date required by Section 2B.05(a)), in which case the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be reduced by the amount so applied as otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence, and any amounts actually received pursuant to Section 2B.05(a) shall be applied to reimburse B/G Participants as provided in following Section 2B.04(d)

-33-





 





          (d) Whenever any Bank Guaranty Issuer receives a payment of a reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for the account of such Bank Guaranty Issuer any payments from the B/G Participants (or from the Deposit Bank on their behalf) pursuant to Section 2B.04(c) above, such Bank Guaranty Issuer shall, after paying itself any amounts owing to it as described in Section 2C.03 in the case of payments received with respect to Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties, pay (in same day funds in Dollars) to the Administrative Agent (and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay (in same day funds in Dollars) each B/G Participant which has paid its CL Percentage thereof), an amount equal to such B/G Participant’s share (based on the proportionate aggregate amount funded by such B/G Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all B/G Participants) of the principal amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

          (e) Each Bank Guaranty Issuer shall, promptly after the issuance of, or amendment or modification to, a Bank Guaranty, give the Administrative Agent and the respective Account Party written notice of such issuance, amendment or modification, as the case may be, and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Bank Guaranty, such amendment or such modification, as the case may be. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each B/G Participant, in writing, of such issuance, amendment or modification and if any B/G Participant shall so request, the Administrative Agent shall furnish said B/G Participant with a copy of such Bank Guaranty, such amendment or such modification, as the case may be.

          (f) Each Bank Guaranty Issuer (other than DBAG) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Deposit Bank, promptly on the first Business Day of each week, by facsimile transmission, the aggregate daily Face Amount available to be drawn under each outstanding Bank Guaranty issued by such Bank Guaranty Issuer for the previous week.

          (g) The obligations of the B/G Participants to make payments to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer with respect to Bank Guar anties issued by it shall be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

     (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Credit Documents;

     (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Bank Guaranty, any transferee of any Bank Guaranty (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Agent, any Lender, any Bank Guaranty Issuer, any B/G Participant, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Bank Guaranty, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction between any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary named in any such Bank Guaranty);

-34-





 





     (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any Bank Guaranty proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

     (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

     (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default;

provided that the B/G Participants shall not be obligated to reimburse such Bank Guaranty Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such Bank Guaranty Issuer under a Bank Guaranty issued by it as a result of deliberate acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Bank Guaranty Issuer (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Bank Guaranty Issuer under or in connection with any Bank Guaranty shall not create for such Bank Guaranty Issuer any resulting liability to the B/G Participants or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          2B.05 Agreement to Repay Bank Guaranty Payments. (a) The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees (in the case of U.S. Borrower Bank Guaranties) and the Bermuda Borrower hereby agrees (in the case of Bermuda Borrower Bank Guaranties) to reimburse the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer, by making payment in Dollars (if the respective Bank Guaranty is denominated in an Alternative Currency, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the respective payment or disbursement, as determined by the Administrative Agent on the date of such payment or disbursement) to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Payment Office (or by making the payment directly to such Bank Guaranty Issuer at such location as may otherwise have been agreed upon by the respective Account Party and such Bank Guaranty Issuer), for any payment or disbursement (in the case of any such payment or disbursement under any Non-Dollar De nominated Bank Guaranty, taking the Dollar Equivalent, as determined by the Administrative Agent, of the amount of the respective payment or disbursement on the date upon which the respective payment or disbursement is made) made by such Bank Guaranty Issuer under any Bank Guaranty issued by it (each such amount so paid until reimbursed, an “Unreimbursed Payment”), not later than the third Business Day after the Administrative Agent or the Bank Guaranty Issuer notifies the respective Account Party of such payment or disbursement (provided that no such notice shall be required to be given if a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case all such Unreimbursed Payments shall be due and payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of which are hereby waived by the respective Account Party)), with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such Bank Guaranty Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time), on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such Bank Guaranty Issuer is reimbursed by the respective Account Party therefor at a rate per annum which shall be equal to Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin for Tranche B Term Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time; provided, however, to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the third Business Day following the receipt by an Account Party of notice of such payment or disbursement (or, if sooner, from the

-35-





 





date of occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05, interest shall thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Bank Guaranty Issuer (and until reimbursed by the respective Account Party) at a rate per annum which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to the respective Unreimbursed Payment as provided above, with all such interest payable pursuant to this Section 2B.05 to be payable on demand. The respective Bank Guaranty Issuer shall give the respective Account Party prompt notice of each Bank Guaranty Payment under any Bank Guaranty, provided that the failure to give, or any delay in giving, any such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish the respective Account Party’s obligations under this Agreement. The obligations of the respective Account Party to repay Unreimbursed Payments as required above shall not be reduced, or satisfied, in any respect by payments made to the Issuing Lender with any amounts on deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or as otherwise provided in Section 2B.04(c).

          (b) The obligations of the U.S. Borrower (with respect to U.S. Borrower Bank Guaranties) and the Bermuda Borrower (with respect to Bermuda Borrower Bank Guaranties) under this Section 2B.05 to reimburse the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer with respect to Unreimbursed Payments (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which the respective Account Party may have or have had against any Lender (including in its capacity as Bank Guaranty Issuer or as B/G Participant), including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any payment under a Bank Guaranty (each, a “Bank Guaranty Payment”) to conform to the terms of such Bank Guaranty or any nonapplication or misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Bank Guaranty Payment, the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer’s only obligation to the respective Account Party being to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Bank Guaranty appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their face with requirements of such Bank Guaranty; provided, however, that no Account Party shall be obligated to reimburse any Bank Guaranty Issuer for any wrongful payment made by such Bank Guaranty Issuer under a Bank Guaranty issued by it as a result of deliberate acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Bank Guaranty Issuer (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Bank Guaranty Issuer under or in connection with any Bank Guaranty shall not create for such Bank Guaranty Issuer any resulting liability to any Account Party unless such action is taken or admitted to be taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          2B.06 Increased Costs. If after the Restatement Effective Date, the Deposit Bank, any Bank Guaranty Issuer or any B/G Participant determines in good faith that the adoption or effectiveness after the Restatement Effective Date of any applicable law, rule or regulation, order, guideline or request or any change therein, or any change after the Restatement Effective Date in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Deposit Bank, any Bank Guaranty Issuer or any B/G Participant with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall either (i) impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against Bank Guaranties issued by such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant’s participation therein, or (ii) impose on the Deposit Bank, any Bank

-36-





 





Guaranty Issuer or any B/G Participant any other conditions directly or indirectly affecting this Agreement, the Credit-Linked Deposits, any Bank Guaranty or such B/G Participant’s participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in the Credit-Linked Deposits, any Bank Guaranty, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant hereunder or under the other Credit Documents or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect to Bank Guaranties, then, upon written demand to the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, by the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant (a copy of which notice shall be sent by the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant to the Administrative Agent), accompanied by the certificate described in the last sentence of this Section 2B.06, the respective Account Party shall pay to the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate submitted to the relevant Account Party by the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Deposit Bank, such Bank Guaranty Issuer or such B/G Participant as aforesaid shall be final and conclusive and binding on such Account Party absent manifest error, although the failure to deliver any such certificate shall not release or diminish such Account Party’s obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2B.06 upon subsequent receipt of such certificate.

          2B.07 Cash Collateralization. No later than the date occurring ten Business Days prior to the CL Maturity Date, the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, shall either (i) terminate each Bank Guaranty issued to it without an expiry date (and cause each such terminated Bank Guaranty to be surrendered for termination to the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer) or (ii) enter into cash collateral arrangements with each Bank Guaranty Issuer which shall have issued a Bank Guaranty to it without an expiry date on terms satisfactory to such Bank Guaranty Issuer and the Administrative Agent, with the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, depositing cash and/or Cash Equivalents (in the respective currency or currencies of the respective Bank Guaranties, and in such amounts as will fully cash collateralize the maximum future payments that could be made under the respective Bank Guaranties) pursuant to such cash collateral arrangements to be held as security for all Bank Guaranty Outstandings of the U.S. Borrower or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, in respect of such Bank Guaranties. If (and only if) all actions required above are taken to the satisfaction of the relevant Bank Guaranty Issuers and the Administrative Agent, the Aggregate CL Exposure attributable to the Bank Guaranties so fully cash collateralized shall be deemed to be $0 (including for purposes of Section 2C.04(a); provided that unless and until such actions are taken the full amount of Bank Guaranty Outstandings relating thereto shall be included in determining the Aggregate CL Exposure (including for purposes of Section 2C.04(a)).

          Section 2C. Special Provisions.

          2C.01 Credit-Linked Deposit Account. (a) On the Restatement Effective Date and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Sections 5 and 6, each CL Lender on such date shall pay to the Deposit Bank such CL Lender’s Credit-Linked Deposit.

-37-





 





The Credit-Linked Deposits shall be held by the Deposit Bank in (or credited to) the Credit-Linked Deposit Account, and no Person other than the Deposit Bank shall have a right of withdrawal from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or any other right or power with respect to the Credit-Linked Deposits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the funding obligation of each CL Lender in respect of its participation in CL Credit Events shall be satisfied in full upon the funding in full of its Credit-Linked Deposit.

          (b) Each of the Deposit Bank, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, each Bank Guaranty Issuer and each CL Lender hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) each CL Lender is funding its Credit-Linked Deposit to the Deposit Bank for application in the manner contemplated by Sections 2A.04 and 2B.04, (ii) the Deposit Bank may invest the Credit-Linked Deposits in such investments as may be determined from time to time by the Deposit Bank and (iii) the Deposit Bank has agreed to pay to the Administrative Agent, who shall in turn pay to each CL Lender, a return on its Credit-Linked Deposit (except (x) during periods when such Credit-Linked Deposits are used to reimburse an Issuing Lender or a Bank Guaranty Issuer, as the case may be, with respect to payments and disbursements on Letters of Credit and/or Bank Guaranties or (y) as otherwise provided in Sections 2C.01(d) and 2C.01(e)) for each CL Lender equal at any time to the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect for the Credit-Linked Deposits at such time less the Credit-Linked Deposit Cost Amount at such time. Such interest will be paid to the CL Lenders (solely from amounts received by it from the Deposit Bank) at the LIBOR Rate for an Interest Period of three months (or at an amount determined in accordance with Sections 2C.01(d) or 2C.01(e), as applicable) less, in each case, the Credit-Linked Deposit Cost Amount in arrears on each CL Interest Payment Date.

          (c) The U.S. Borrower, the Bermuda Borrower or any other Credit Party shall not have (x) any right, title or interest in or to the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or the Credit- Linked Deposits and/or (y) any obligations with respect thereto (except to refund portions thereof used to reimburse (I) an Issuing Lender with respect to payments or disbursements on Letters of Credit as provided in Section 2A.04 and/or (II) a Bank Guaranty Issuer with respect to payments or disbursements on Bank Guaranties as provided in Section 2B.04), it being acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that the funding of the Credit-Linked Deposits by the CL Lenders to the Deposit Bank for deposit in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account and the application of the Credit-Linked Deposits in the manner contemplated by Sections 2A.04 and 2B.04 constitute agreements among the Deposit Bank, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender, each Bank Guaranty Issuer and each CL Lender with respect to the L/C Participations in the Letters of Credit and the B/G Participations in the Bank Guaranties and do not constitute any loan or extension of credit to the U.S. Borrower, the Bermuda Borrower or any other Credit Party.

          (d) If the Deposit Bank is not offering Dollar deposits (in the applicable amounts) in the applicable Eurodollar interbank market, or the Deposit Bank determines that adequate and fair means do not otherwise exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for the Credit-Linked Deposits (or any part thereof), then the Credit-Linked Deposits (or such parts, as applicable) shall be invested so as to earn a return equal to the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Rate and (y) a rate determined by the Deposit Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

-38-





 





          (e) If any (x) payment or disbursement under a Letter of Credit that has been funded by the CL Lenders from the Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in Section 2A.04(c) or (y) payment or disbursement under a Bank Guaranty that has been funded by the CL Lenders from the Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in Section 2B.04(c) shall, in either case, be reimbursed by the applicable Account Party (or another Person on its behalf) on a day other than on the last day of an Interest Period or Scheduled Investment Termination Date applicable to the Credit-Linked Deposits, the Administrative Agent shall, upon receipt thereof, pay over such amounts to the Deposit Bank which, in turn, will invest the amount so reimbursed in overnight or short-term cash equivalent investments until the end of the Interest Period or Scheduled Investment Termination Date at the time in effect and the respective Account Party shall pay to the Deposit Bank, upon the Deposit Bank’s request therefor (provided that if an Event of Default specified in Section 10.05 shall occur with respect to either Borrower, the result which would occur upon the giving of such request by the Deposit Bank shall occur automatically without the giving of any such request), the amount, if any, by which the interest accrued on a like amount of the Credit-Linked Deposits at the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect therefor shall exceed the interest earned through the investment of the amount so reimbursed for the period from the date of such repayment or reimbursement through the end of the applicable Interest Period, as determined by the Deposit Bank (such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto) and set forth in the request for payment delivered to the respective Account Party. In the event that the respective Account Party shall fail to pay any amount due under this Section 2C.01(e), the interest payable by the Deposit Bank to the CL Lenders on their Credit-Linked Deposits under Section 2C.01(b) shall be correspondingly reduced and the CL Lenders shall, without further act, succeed, ratably in accordance with their respective CL Percentages, to the rights of the Deposit Bank with respect to such amount due from the respective Account Party. All reimbursements of (x) Drawings under Letters of Credit that have been funded by the CL Lenders from the Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in Section 2A.04(c) or (y) Bank Guaranty Payments under Bank Guaranties that have been funded by the CL Lenders from the Credit-Linked Deposits as provided in Section 2B.04(c), in each case received by the Administrative Agent prior to the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment, shall be paid over to the Deposit Bank which will deposit same in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account. The Account Party shall not have any responsibility or liability to the CL Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any other Person in respect of the establishment, maintenance, administration or misappropriation of the Credit-Linked Deposit Account or with respect to the investment of amounts held therein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2C.01(e), the Administrative Agent, acting in its capacity as such, shall be entitled to the indemnities provided elsewhere in this Agreement.

          2C.02 European Monetary Union. The following provisions of this Section 2C.02 shall come into effect on and from the date on which the United Kingdom becomes a Participating Member State. Each obligation under this Agreement which has been denominated in Sterling shall be redenominated into Euros in accordance with the relevant EMU Legislation. However, if and to the extent that the relevant EMU Legislation provides that an amount which is denominated in Sterling can be paid by the debtor either in Euros or in that national currency unit, each party to this Agreement shall be entitled to pay or repay any amount denominated or owing in Sterling hereunder either in Euros or in Sterling. Without prejudice and in addition to any method of conversion or rounding prescribed by any relevant EMU Legislation, (i) each ref-

-39-





 





erence in this Agreement to a minimum amount (or an integral multiple thereof) in Sterling shall be replaced by a reference to such reasonably comparable and convenient amount (or an integral multiple thereof) in Euros as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify and (ii) except as expressly provided in this Section 2C.02, this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction of or changeover to Euros in the United Kingdom, provided that this Section 2C.02 shall not reduce or increase any actual or contingent liability arising under this Agreement.

          2C.03 Special Provisions Regarding Non-Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit and Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties. As an accommodation to each of the Account Parties, it is understood and agreed that the respective Issuing Lenders and Bank Guaranty Issuers may, but shall not be obligated to, issue from time to time Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties, as the case may be, denominated in Alternative Currencies, otherwise in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Section 2. The respective Issuing Lender or Bank Guaranty Issuer, as the case may be, may, at any time, in its sole discretion, determine not to issue Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties, as the case may be, denominated in any Alternative Currency. If any Non-Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit and/or Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties are from time to time issued, it is understood that the definitions of Stated Amount (in the case of Non-Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit) and Face Amount (in the case of Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties) contained in this Agreement are each, respectively, designed to provide (pursuant to the proviso thereto) a cushion to reduce the risk that the sum of (x) the aggregate Unpaid Drawings with respect to the Letters of Credit and (y) the aggregate Unreimbursed Payments with respect to the Bank Guaranties would ever exceed the aggregate amount of Credit-Linked Deposits available to repay same. Nonetheless, it is possible, because of currency fluctuations, that the sum of the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings and Bank Guaranty Outstandings would exceed the amount of Credit-Linked Deposits from time to time. If that situation ever occurs at any time, the U.S. Borrower and/or the Bermuda Borrower, as the case may be, shall immediately make all payments required pursuant to Section 4.02(a). Furthermore, if a Drawing occurs under any Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit or a Bank Guaranty Payment occurs under any Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty at a time when the sum of the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings and Bank Guaranty Outstandings exceeds the Total Credit-Linked Deposits as a result of currency fluctuations after the initial issuance of the respective Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit and/or Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty, as the case may be, then, unless the respective Account Party repays such Drawing and/or Bank Guaranty Payment (or the portion thereof which represents the excess amounts described above), (x) the respective Issuing Lender shall bear the risk on that portion of the Unpaid Drawings with respect to such Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit which represents the excess of the sum of the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings and Bank Guaranty Outstandings over the amount of Credit-Linked Deposits (but only to the extent caused by currency fluctuations after the issuance of the respective Non-Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit) and (y) the respective Bank Guaranty Issuer shall bear the risk on that portion of the Bank Guaranty Payments with respect to such Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranties which represents the excess of the sum of the aggregate Letter of Credit Outstandings and Bank Guaranty Outstandings over the amount of Credit-Linked Deposits (but only to the extent caused by currency fluctuations after the issuance of the respective Non-Dollar Denominated Bank Guaranty), and any payments received by the Issuing Lender or Bank Guaranty Issuer, as the case may be, (or others on their respective be-

-40-





 





half) with respect to such Unpaid Drawings (and interest thereon, which shall in any event be payable at the rates specified in Section 2A.05(a)) and/or Unreimbursed Payments (and interest thereon, which shall in any event be payable at the rates specified in Section 2B.05(a)), shall be retained by the respective Issuing Lender or Bank Guaranty Issuer, as the case may be, for its own account. Any amounts owing to an Issuing Lender or Bank Guaranty Issuer as described above in this Section 2C.03 shall be entitled to elevated priorities with respect to cash collateral as described in Section 4.02(a) and the enhanced priorities described in Section 7.4 of the U.S. Security Agreement.

          2C.04 Special Provisions Regarding Return Of Credit-Linked Deposits.

If at the time of any determination pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence the amount determined pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence exceeded the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the Deposit Bank shall from time to time thereafter, upon the direction of the Administrative Agent, return to the Administrative Agent who shall, in turn, return to the CL Lenders (ratably in accordance with their CL Percentages) their Credit-Linked Deposits to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof from time to time exceeds the greater of (x) the Total Credit-Linked Commitment after giving effect to prior reductions thereto or terminations thereof and (y) the Aggregate CL Exposure at such time.

Each reduction to the Total Incremental Term Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(a) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments of the respective Tranche of Incremental Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining principal amount of the Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments of such Tranche after giving effect to all prior reductions thereto).

          (b) Upon at least three Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the CL Lenders), the U.S. Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, to terminate the Total Unutilized Credit-Linked Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part in aggregate minimum amounts of $1,000,000, provided that no

-44-





 





such reduction shall be permitted to be made pursuant to this Section 3.02(b) if the effect thereof is to cause the Aggregate CL Exposure to exceed the Total Credit-Linked Commitment after giving effect to the reduction thereto pursuant to this Section 3.02(b). Each reduction to the Total Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(b) shall apply to proportionately and permanently reduce the Credit-Linked Commitment of each CL Lender (based on their respective CL Percentages). At the time of any termination or reduction of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(b), the Administrative Agent shall request the Deposit Bank to (and the Deposit Bank agrees that it will) withdraw from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account and to pay same over to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall return to the CL Lenders (ratably in accordance with their respective CL Percentages) their Credit-Linked Deposits in an amount by which the aggregate amount of the Credit-Linked Deposits at such time exceeds the Total Credit-Linked Commitment as in effect immediately after giving effect to such termination. Each termination of all or any portion of the Total Unutilized Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(b) made prior to the first anniversary of the Restatement Effective Date in connection with a Repricing Transaction shall be subject to the payment of the fee described in Section 3.01(h).

          (c) In the event of certain refusals by a Lender as provided in Section 4.01 or 13.12(b) to consent to certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders, the applicable Incremental Term Loan Borrower may, subject to the applicable requirements of said Sections 4.01 and/or 13.12(b), upon five Business Days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders) terminate the Incremental Term Loan Commitments, if any, and/or the Credit-Linked Commitment, if any, of such Lender, so long as (x) all Loans, Unpaid Drawings and Unreimbursed Payments (to the extent that such Lender’s Credit-Linked Commitment is being terminated), together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other amounts, owing to such Lender (excluding amounts owing in respect of Loans of any Tranche maintained by such Lender which are not being repaid pursuant to Section 13.12(b)) are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect such changed amounts) and (y) after giving effect to such termination (and the adjustments to the CL Percentages of the remaining Lenders as contemplated below), the Individual CL Exposure of any remaining CL Lender shall not exceed its Credit-Linked Commitment. After giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of any Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.02(c), unless the respective Lender continues to have outstanding Term Loans or other Commitments (if any) hereunder, such Lender shall no longer constitute a “Lender” for purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to indemnifications under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2A.06, 2B.06, 4.04, 13.01 and 13.06), which shall survive as to such repaid Lender. In cases where the Credit-Linked Commitments of any Lender are terminated pursuant to this Section 3.02(c), except in cases where the respective Credit-Linked Commitments are replaced in full, after giving effect to the termination of any such Credit-Linked Commitments of a given Lender pursuant to this Section 3.02(c), there shall occur automatic adjustments (as determined by the Administrative Agent) in the respective CL Percentages of the remaining CL Lenders in accordance with the definition of CL Percentage contained herein. At the time of any termination of a CL Lender’s Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(c), the Administrative Agent shall request the Deposit Bank to (and the Deposit Bank agrees that it will) withdraw from the Credit-Linked Deposit Account and to pay same over to

-45-





 





the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall return to such CL Lender its Credit-Linked Deposit; provided that if, and to the extent, the respective CL Lender is replaced by way of assignment, then its Credit-Linked Deposit shall remain in the Credit-Linked Deposit Account and the respective assignee shall pay the assigning CL Lender an amount equal to the Credit-Linked Deposit so assigned. Each reduction to the Total Incremental Term Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02(c) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments of the respective Tranche of Incremental Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining principal amount of the Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments of such Tranche after giving effect to all prior reductions thereto).

          3.03 Mandatory Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Total Commitment (and the Tranche B Term Loan Commitment, the Tranche C Term Loan Commitment and the Credit-Linked Commitment of each Lender with such a Commitment) shall terminate in its entirety on April 12, 2006, unless the Restatement Effective Date has occurred on or before such date.

          In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Tranche B Term Loan Commitment (and the Tranche B Term Loan Commitment of each Lender with such a Commitment) shall terminate in its entirety on the Restatement Effective Date (after giving effect to the making of Tranche B Term Loans on such date).

          (c) In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be reduced on the dates, and in the amounts provided in Sections 2A.04(c) and 2B.04(c). At the time of any termination or reduction of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment pursuant to Section 2A.04(c), Section 2B.04(c), this Section 3.03 or Section 10, the actions required by Section 2C.04(a) shall be taken. Each reduction to, or termination of, the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall be applied to proportionately reduce or terminate, as the case may be, the Credit-Linked Commitment of each CL Lender (in accordance with their respective CL Percentages).

          (d) In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Incremental Term Loan Commitment under a given Tranche shall (i) be permanently reduced on each Incremental Term Loan Borrowing Date in respect of such Tranche in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Incremental Term Loans of such Tranche incurred on each such date, (ii) terminate in its entirety (to the extent not theretofore terminated) on the Incremental Term Loan Commitment Termination Date for such Tranche of Incremental Term Loans (after giving effect to any Incremental Term Loans of such Tranche to be made on such date) and (iii) prior to the termination of the Total Incremental Term Loan Commitment in respect of such Tranche, be permanently reduced from time to time to the extent required by Section 4.02.

          (g) (I) Each amount required to be applied pursuant to Sections 4.02(c), (d), (e), and (f) in accordance with this Section 4.02(g) shall be applied, subject to immediately succeeding clause (IV), (i) first, to repay the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and (ii) second, to the extent in excess of the amounts applied pursuant to preceding clause (i), as a mandatory reduction to the Total Incremental Term Loan Commitment in effect at such time (if any).

          (II) Each amount required to be applied to repay outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 4.02(g) shall, subject to succeeding clause (IV) and the immediately succeeding proviso, be applied pro rata to each Tranche of Term Loans (based upon the TL Repayment Percentages of the various Tranches of Term Loans and the then outstanding principal amounts of the respective Tranches of Term Loans); provided that (i) the Net Sale Proceeds from any Asset Sale effected by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries and proceeds from any Recovery Event with respect to the properties or assets of the U.S. Borrower or any of its Domestic Subsidiaries and, in each case, required to be applied to the repayment of Term Loans pursuant to clause (I) of this Section 4.02(g), shall be applied (x) first, to repay principal of outstanding Tranche B Term Loans and U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans, if any (on a pro rata basis to each Tranche of U.S. Borrower Term Loans based on the TL Repayment Percentages of such Tranches of U.S. Borrower Term Loans and the then outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans and each such Tranche of U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans (but, for such purposes, as if no Bermuda Borrower Term Loans were then outstanding)) and (y) second, after the repayment in full of all outstanding U.S. Borrower Term Loans, to repay principal of outstanding Tranche C Term Loans and Bermuda Borrower Incremental Term Loans (on a pro rata basis to each such Tranche of Term Loans, based upon the TL Repayment Percentages of such Tranches of Term Loans and the then outstanding principal amounts of such Tranches of Term Loans) and (ii) the Net Sale Proceeds from any Asset Sale effected by any Foreign Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower and the proceeds from any Recovery Event with respect to the properties or assets of any Foreign Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower and, in each case, required to be applied to the repayment of Term Loans pursuant to clause (I) of this Section 4.02(g), shall be applied (x) first, to repay principal of outstanding Tranche C Term Loans and Bermuda Borrower Incremental Term Loans (on a pro rata basis to each such Tranche of Term Loans, based upon the TL Repayment Percentages of such Tranches of Term Loans and the then outstanding principal amounts of such Tranches of Term Loans (but, for such purposes, as if no U.S. Borrower Term Loans were then outstanding)) and (y) second, after the repayment in full of all outstanding Bermuda Borrower Term Loans, to repay principal of outstanding Tranche B Term Loans and U.S. Borrower Incremental Term Loans, if any (on a pro rata basis to each Tranche of U.S. Borrower Term Loans based on the TL Repayment Percentages of such

-55-





 





Tranches of U.S. Borrower Term Loans and the then outstanding principal amount of such Tranches of U.S. Borrower Term Loans).

          (III) All repayments or commitment reductions, as the case may be, of outstanding Term Loans or Incremental Term Loan Commitments of a given Tranche, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 4.02(c), (d), (e) or (f) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Scheduled Repayments of the respective Tranche of Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining principal amounts of the Scheduled Repayments of such Tranche of Term Loans after giving effect to all prior reductions thereto); provided that if Incremental Term Loan Commitments of a given Tranche are not included as part of the Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments for such Tranche set forth in the respective Incremental Term Loan Commitment Agreement (e.g., because the Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments are set forth on a percentage basis rather in a Dollar amount), no such reduction to the respective Incremental Term Loan Scheduled Repayments shall be required as a result of a reduction in the Incremental Term Loan Commitments of such Tranche.

          (IV) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.02, neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to apply any Net Sale Proceeds pursuant to this Section 4.02(g) to the extent attributable to any Asset Sales of ABL Priority Collateral (including, in the case of an Asset Sale consisting of the sale of all or substantially all of the capital stock or equity interests in, any U.S. Credit Party, that portion of the proceeds determined in good faith by the U.S. Borrower to be attributable to the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such U.S. Credit Party at the time of the consummation of such Asset Sale) to the extent that such Net Sale Proceeds are required to be and are applied to the repayment of ABL Loans (or to the permanent reduction of any commitment under the ABL Credit Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement.

          (h) With respect to each repayment of Loans required by this Section 4.02, the respective Borrower may (subject to the requirements of preceding Section 4.02(g)) designate the Types of Loans of the respective Tranche which are to be repaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the specific Borrowing or Borrowings of the respective Tranche pursuant to which made, provided that: (i) in the case of repayments of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 4.02 on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, such repayments shall be accompanied by payment by the respective Borrower of all amounts owing in connection therewith pursuant to Section 1.11(a), (ii) if any repayment of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable to the Eurodollar Loans, such Borrowing, shall be converted at the end of the then current Interest Period into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, and (iii) each repayment of any Tranche of Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata among such Tranche of Loans. In the absence of a designation by the respective Borrower as described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make such designation in its sole discretion with a view, but no obligation, to minimize breakage costs owing under Section 1.11(a).

          (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) all other then outstanding Loans shall be repaid in full on the respective Maturity Date for such Loans and (ii) unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing in their

-56-





 





sole discretion, all outstanding Loans shall be repaid in full upon the occurrence of a Change of Control.

          (j) For purposes of clarity, it is understood and agreed that none of Sections 4.02(c) through (f), inclusive, shall require that amounts received by any Foreign Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiaries be used to repay Obligations owed by any U.S. Credit Parties, but that said Sections merely determine the amounts required to be applied by the various Borrowers to the repayment of their Obligations as more fully described in this Section 4.02.

          (k) In addition to the mandatory repayments required above, on the Restatement Effective Date the Borrowers shall make all repayments required pursuant to Section 4.02(a) of the Original Credit Agreement as a result of the termination of the Total Multicurrency Facility Revolving Loan Commitment (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement) and the termination of the Total Dollar Facility Revolving Loan Commitment (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement), as provided in Section 3.03(g) hereof; provided that no cash collateralization shall be required with respect to any Existing Letter of Credit or Existing Bank Guaranty, each as defined herein. Also on the Restatement Effective Date, the Borrowers shall cause all Letters of Credit (other than Existing Letters of Credit as defined herein) and Bank Guaranties (other than Existing Bank Guaranties as defined herein) under, and as defined in, the Original Credit Agreement to be terminated and returned to the respective Issuing Lender (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement) or Bank Guaranty Issuer (as defined in the Original Credit Agreement). On the Restatement Effective Date, the respective Borrowers shall also be obligated to pay to the Original Lenders any breakage or other costs of the type referred to in Section 1.11 of the Original Credit Agreement (if any) incurred in connection with the repayments required above.

          In addition to the mandatory repayments required above, on the Restatement Effective Date the Borrower shall repay in full all outstanding Tranche A Term Loans under, and as defined in, the Original Credit Agreement. On the Restatement Effective Date, the Bermuda Borrower shall also be obligated to pay to the respective Original Lenders any breakage or other costs of the type referred to in Section 1.11 of the Original Credit Agreement (if any) incurred in connection with the repayments required above.

          4.03 Method and Place of Payment.

Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable rate during such extension.

          4.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by any Credit Party under any Credit Document (including, in the case of a Credit Agreement Party, in its capacity as a guarantor pursuant to Section 14) or under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense. Except as provided in Section 4.04(b), all such payments will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed on or measured by the net income of a Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to collectively as “Taxes”). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the respective Borrower (and any other Credit Party making the payment) agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the respective Borrower (and any other Credit Party making the payment) shall be obligated to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender, for the net additional taxes (after taking into account available credits with respect to such withholding taxes) imposed on or measured by the net income of such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located and for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall determine are payable by, or withheld from, such Lender in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence, the respective Borrower (or Credit Party) will furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date of the payment of any Taxes due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by such Borrower (or the respective other Credit Party). The Credit Agreement Parties jointly and severally agree (and each Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to its respective Subsidiary Guaranty, and the incorporation by reference therein of the provisions of this Section 4.04, shall agree) to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

          (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Restatement Effective Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04 (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender’s entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if

-58-





 





the Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such certificate, a “Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate”) and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to such Lender’s entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to time after the Restatement Effective Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, it will deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately notify the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section 4.04(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.04(a), but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the U.S. Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees or other amounts payable by the U.S. Borrower hereunder for the account of any Lender which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the U.S. Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the U.S. Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 4.04(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the U.S. Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such forms do not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section 4.04 and except as set forth in Section 13.04(b), the U.S. Borrower agrees to pay additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth in Section 4.04(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence (x) as a result of any changes after the Restatement Effective Date (or, if later, the date such Lender became party to this Agreement) in any applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of income or similar taxes or (y) as a result of the purchase of a participation as required by Section 1.14 following the occurrence of a Sharing Event.

(a) (i) Each Credit Agreement Party will comply, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to the ownership or use of its Real Property and vessels now or hereafter owned, leased or operated by such Credit Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries, will promptly pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incurred in connection with such compliance, and will keep or cause to be kept all such Real Property and vessels free and clear of any Liens imposed pursuant to such Environmental Laws and (ii) neither any Credit Agreement Party nor any of its Subsidiaries will generate, use, treat, store, Release or dispose of, or permit the generation, use, treatment, storage, Release or disposal of, Hazardous Materials on any Real Property or vessels owned, leased or operated by such Credit Agreement Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or transport or permit the transportation of Hazardous Materials to or from any such Real Property, except as required in the ordinary course of business of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries as conducted on the Original Effective Date and as allowed by (and in compliance with) applicable law or regulation and except for any failures to comply with the requirements specified in clause (i) or (ii) above, which, either individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. If the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any tenant or occupant of any Real Property or vessel owned, leased or operated by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, causes or permits any intentional or unintentional act or omission resulting in the presence or Release of any Hazardous Material (except in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws), each Credit Agreement Party agrees to undertake, and/or to cause any of its Subsidiaries, tenants or occupants to undertake, at their sole expense, any clean up, removal, remedial or other action required pursuant to Environmental Laws to remove and clean up any Hazardous Materials from any Real Property or vessel except where the failure to do so has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

the original Mortgages or Foreign Security Agreements, as appropriate and (iii) such Leasehold Properties to which a respective landlord has granted its consent to the delivery of a Mortgage over such Leasehold Properties (each such Real Property referred to in preceding clause (ii) and this clause (iii), an “Additional Mortgaged Property”); provided, however that if the aggregate value of all Second-Tier Material Real Properties (for such purpose, using the initial purchase price paid by such Person for the respective Second-Tier Material Real Property) acquired by such Persons after the Initial Borrowing Date which are not then covered by Mortgages or Foreign Security Agreements, as appropriate, equals or exceeds $20,000,000, each Credit Agreement Party and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall grant to the Collateral Agent security interests and mortgages in all such Second-Tier Material Real Properties owned by any such Person which are not then covered by Mortgages or Foreign Security Agreements, as appropriate (and not just those required to reduce the aggregate value of all Second-Tier Material Real Properties (determined as provided above) at such time below $20,000,000). All such Additional Mortgages shall be granted pursuant to documentation substantially in the form of a relevant existing Mortgage (or, in the case of Additional Mortgaged Properties located in a jurisdiction outside the United States, the relevant Foreign Security Agreement covering Real Property located in such jurisdiction (if any) delivered to the Administrative Agent on the Initial Borrowing Date) or in such other form as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

ty, the Intercompany Subordination Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and such Security Documents as would have been entered into by the respective Subsidiary if same had been a U.S. Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement on the Initial Borrowing Date (with appropriate changes to reflect the amendment and restatement of this Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date and any subsequent modification hereto), and in each case shall take all action in connection therewith as would otherwise have been required to be taken pursuant to Section 5 of the Original Credit Agreement if such Subsidiary had been a U.S. Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement on the Initial Borrowing Date, (x) at any time any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower organized under the laws of any Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction is created, established or acquired, such Subsidiary shall be required to execute and deliver counterparts of the Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty, the Intercompany Subordination Agreement and such Security Documents as would have been entered into by the respective Subsidiary if same had been a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement on the Initial Borrowing Date (with appropriate changes to reflect the amendment and restatement of this Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date and any subsequent modification hereto) (determined in accordance with the criteria described in Sections 5.15, 5.17 and 5.18(b) of the Original Credit Agreement), and in each case shall take all action in connection therewith as would otherwise have been required to be taken pursuant to Section 5 of the Original Credit Agreement if such Subsidiary had been a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement on the Initial Borrowing Date (with appropriate changes to reflect the amendment and restatement of this Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date and any subsequent modification hereto), (y) at any time any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower organized under the laws of any Non-Qualified Jurisdiction in which a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement was organized on the Initial Borrowing Date is created, established or acquired, such Subsidiary shall be required to execute and deliver counterparts of the Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty and, in each case, unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees based on advice of local counsel, the Intercompany Subordination Agreement and such Security Documents as would have been entered into by the respective Subsidiary if same had been a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement organized under the laws of such Non-Qualified Jurisdiction on the Initial Borrowing Date (with appropriate changes to reflect the amendment and restatement of this Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date and any subsequent modification hereto) (determined in accordance with the criteria described in Sections 5.15, 5.17 and 5.18(b) of the Original Credit Agreement), and in each case shall take all action in connection therewith as would otherwise have been required to be taken pursuant to Section 5 of the Original Credit Agreement if such Subsidiary had been a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor under the Original Credit Agreement organized under the laws of such Non-Qualified Jurisdiction on the Initial Borrowing Date (with appropriate changes to reflect the amendment and restatement of this Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date and any subsequent modification hereto) and (z) if at any time after the Initial Borrowing Date any jurisdiction is added to the list of Qualified Jurisdictions in accordance with the definition thereof contained herein, then at the time of such designation each Foreign Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower organized under the laws of such Qualified Jurisdiction (with such exceptions as may be satisfactory to the Administrative Ag ent or the Required Lenders) shall be required to become a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor and take all actions specified in preceding clause (x). Furthermore, subject to the provisions of Section 8.11(h), the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may at any time request that one or more Subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower organized under the laws of one or more jurisdictions which are not Qualified Jurisdic-

tions become Foreign Subsidiary Guarantors, in which case the Credit Agreement Parties shall cause each such Subsidiary which has been specifically requested to become a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor to take all actions as are specified in clause (x) of the immediately preceding sentence, provided that no Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower shall be required to take such actions if, and to the extent that, based upon written advice of local counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the U.S. Borrower and/or such Subsidiary concludes that the taking of such actions would violate the laws of the jurisdiction in which the respective Subsidiary is organized, provided, further, that if steps (such as limiting the amount guaranteed) can be taken so that such violation would not exist, then if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the respective Subsidiary shall enter into a modified Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty which provides, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, as many of the benefits as are provided pursuant to the Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty executed and delivered on the Initial Borrowing Date as is possible.

          (d) In addition to the requirements contained in the Pledge Agreements, each Credit Agreement Party agrees to pledge and deliver, or cause to be pledged and delivered, all of the Equity Interests owned by any Credit Party of each new Unrestricted Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower established or created (and each Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower which becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary) after the Initial Borrowing Date to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors pursuant to the Pledge Agreements, provided that, subject to the provisions of Section 8.12, in the case of any Foreign Unrestricted Subsidiary that is a corporation (or treated as such for U.S. tax purposes) which is owned by a U.S. Credit Party, not more than 65% of the total outstanding voting Equity Interests of such Person shall be required to be pledged in support of such U.S. Credit Party’s obligations (x) as a Borrower under the Credit Agreement (in the case of the U.S. Borrower) or (y) under its Guaranty in respect of the Obligations of the U.S. Borrower (in the case of the other U.S. Credit Parties).

          (e) Following any request by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (but subject to the proviso to preceding Section 8.11(d), to the extent applicable), (x) grant security interests in such of their Property (other than Excluded Collateral) as may be requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, in which perfected security interests do not already exist pursuant to the Security Documents theretofore executed and delivered and, in connection therewith, the Credit Agreement Parties shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower to, execute and deliver counterparts of (and thereby become parties to) the Intercreditor Agreement (in the case of any U.S. Credit Party), the applicable Security Documents and/or Additional Security Documents, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (y) with respect to pledges of Equity Interests of, or promissory notes issued by, Persons described in Section 13.19(a), take such action (including, without limitation, the execution of Additional Security Documents, the making of filings, etc.) under the local law of the Person whose Equity Interests or promissory notes are pledged as may be requested in order to create, preserve, protect or perfect security interests in such Equity Interests and/or promissory notes and/or (z) with respect to each Foreign Security Document described in Section 13.19(b), take such action (including, without limitation, amending, modifying or supplementing such Foreign Security Document, etc.) under the local law of each Credit Party party to such Foreign Security Document as may be requested to effect the amendments, modifications and supplements contemplated in Section 13.19(b).

          (f) The security interests required to be granted pursuant to Sections 8.11(c), (d) and (e) shall be granted pursuant to the respective Security Documents already executed and delivered by the Credit Parties (or other security documentation substantially similar to such Security Documents or otherwise reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Collateral Agent) and shall constitute valid and enforceable first priority perfected security interests (subject to the applicable provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement in the case of security interests granted by any U.S. Credit Party) prior to the rights of all third Persons and subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens). The Credit Agreement Parties shall (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries), (i) at their own expense, to (x) execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause the execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or record in any appropriate governmental office, any document or instrument reasonably deemed by the Collateral Agent to be necessary or desirable for the creation, perfection, maintenance, preservation and protection of the Liens on its assets intended to be created pursuant to the relevant Security Documents and (y) take all other actions reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent (including, without limitation, the furnishing of legal opinions) in connection with the granting of the security interests required pursuant to Sections 8.11(c), (d) and (e) and (ii) pay in full all taxes, fees and other charges payable in connection with the granting of the security interests required pursuant to Sections 8.11(c), (d) and (e).

          (g) Each Credit Agreement Party agrees that each action required above by Section 8.11(a) or (b) shall be completed as soon as possible, but in no event later than 90 days (or, in the case of actions relating to assets located outside the United States, such greater number of days as the Administrative Agent shall agree to in its sole and absolute discretion in any given case) after such action is requested to be taken by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders. Each Credit Agreement Party further agrees that (x) each action required above by Section 8.11(c), (d) and (f) with respect to a newly formed, created or acquired Subsidiary, or with respect to any Subsidiary which is located in a jurisdiction newly-designated as a Qualified Jurisdiction or which becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary, shall be completed contemporaneously with the formation, creation or acquisition of such Subsidiary, the date of the addition of the respective jurisdiction to the list of Qualified Jurisdictions or the date such Subsidiary becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, (provided that (x) the Credit Documents required to be executed and delivered pursuant to Section 8.11(c) by such newly formed, created or acquired Subsidiary shall not be required to be so executed and delivered until 45 days after the formation, creation or acquisition of such Subsidiary, (y) in the case of a Shell Corporation formed, created or established by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, such actions shall not be required to be taken (so long as same remains a Shell Corporation) until 60 days after the formation, creation or establishment of such Shell Corporation and (z) in the case of a newly-formed Subsidiary organized in (i) a Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction or (ii) a Non-Qualified Jurisdiction in which an existing Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor is organized, to defer the execution and delivery of Security Documents (but not counterparts of the Foreign Subsidiaries Guaranty or the Intercompany Subordination Agreement) if the gross book value of its assets (determined as of the last day of the calendar month then last ended) is less than $10,000,000, until (and only until) the aggregate gross book value of all newly-formed Subsidiaries which have not executed Security Documents in reliance on this proviso (determined as of the last day of the calendar month then last ended) exceeds $20,000,000, at which time all such excluded Subsidiaries (and not just those Subsidiaries required to reduce the aggregate gross book value of such excluded Subsidiaries to below $20,000,000) shall execute the required Security Documents) and (y) all actions required

to be taken pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.11(c) and Section 8.11(e) shall be taken as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 45 days, after the U.S. Borrower receives the respective request from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders.

          (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clauses (c) through (g) above, to the extent the taking of any action as described above by a new Subsidiary acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition, which is subject to Permitted Acquired Debt which at such time remains in existence as permitted by Section 9.04(b)(vi), then to the extent that the terms of the respective Permitted Acquired Debt prohibit the taking of any actions which would otherwise be required of such Subsidiary by this Section 8.11, then the time for taking the respective actions (to the extent prohibited by the terms of the respective Permitted Acquired Debt) shall be extended until 10 Business Days after the earlier of (i) the date of repayment of such Permitted Acquired Debt and (ii) the first date on which the taking of such actions would not violate the terms of the respective issue of Permitted Acquired Debt. To the extent the terms of any Permitted Acquired Debt prohibits the taking of actions otherwise required by this Section 8.11, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, each Credit Agreement Party shall, or shall cause the respective Subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower to, (x) prepay any such Permitted Acquired Debt which is permitted to be prepaid and/or (y) use reasonable efforts to obtain such consents or approvals as are needed so that the taking of the actions otherwise specified in this Section 8.11 would not violate the terms of the respective issue of Permitted Acquired Debt. Furthermore, to the extent any Subsidiary which is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary is acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition (in accordance with the limitations contained in the definition thereof), then for so long as such Subsidiary is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, to the extent the U.S. Borrower in good faith determines that the respective Subsidiary is not able, under applicable requirements of law (whether because of fiduciary duties under applicable law or other requirements of applicable law) to execute and deliver a Subsidiaries Guaranty or one or more Security Documents, the respective such Subsidiary shall not be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor or execute and deliver such Security Documents as otherwise required above.

          (i) Within 30 days following the request of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders, the Credit Agreement Parties shall cause each Fee Capped Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) to (x) enter into such amendments and/or modifications to the relevant Credit Documents to which such Fee Capped Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor is a party to cause the guaranty amount or the secured obligations thereunder, as applicable, to equal 110% of the fair market value of the Property owned or held by such Fee Capped Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor and (y) pay all registration, notorial and other fees, all taxes and all other amounts as may be required in connection with the increase in amount of the guaranty and/or the secured obligations under such Credit Documents.

          (j) In the event that the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders at any time after the Initial Borrowing Date determine in their reasonable discretion (whether as a result of a position taken by an applicable bank regulatory agency or official, or otherwise) that real estate appraisals satisfying the requirements set forth in 12 C.F.R., Part 34-Subpart C, or any successor or similar statute, role, regulation, guideline or order (any such appraisal, a “Required Appraisal”) are or were required to be obtained, or should be obtained, in connection with any U.S. Mortgaged Property or U.S. Mortgaged Properties, then, within 90 days after receiving

-86-





 





written notice thereof from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, the U.S. Borrower shall cause such Required Appraisal to be delivered, at the expense of the U.S. Borrower, to the Administrative Agent, which Required Appraisal, and the respective appraiser, shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (k) Notwithstanding any “after-acquired property” covenant contained in any Foreign Security Document requiring the grant of security interests in Property of any Foreign Credit Party in favor of the Collateral Agent (but subject to Sections 8.11(a) and (e)), no Foreign Credit Party shall be required to grant the Collateral Agent security interests in Property of such Foreign Credit Party acquired after the Initial Borrowing Date which is not a vessel and does not constitute Real Property (all such Property, “After-Acquired Foreign Personal Property”) and which is not covered already expressly by the respective Foreign Security Document as otherwise required by such Foreign Security Document if the gross book value of all After-Acquired Foreign Personal Property of such Foreign Credit Party (determined as of the last day of the calendar month then last ended) excluded from the pledge requirements pursuant to this clause (k) is less than $10,000,000, unless (and until) the aggregate gross book value of all After-Acquired Foreign Personal Property of all Foreign Credit Parties excluded from the pledge requirements pursuant to this clause (k) (determined as of the last day of the calendar month then last ended) exceeds $20,000,000, at which time the Foreign Credit Parties shall take all actions required to be taken pursuant to the respective Foreign Security Documents to grant the Collateral Agent a security interest in such theretofore excluded After-Acquired Foreign Personal Property as is required to cause the aggregate gross book value (determined as described above) of all After-Acquired Foreign Personal Property of all Foreign Credit Parties not then subject to a security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the relevant Foreign Security Documents not to exceed $5,000,000.

          (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this Section 8.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, no Credit Party shall be required to grant a security interest in, or Lien on, any Excluded Collateral (so long as the respective Property constitutes Excluded Collateral), and the value of any Excluded Collateral shall not be taken into account in making determinations pursuant to the foregoing clauses of this Section 8.11.

          (m) No later than 45 days after the effective date of Amendment 1 (or such later date as the Administrative Agent shall agree in its sole discretion), the applicable Credit Parties shall cause to be executed and/or delivered, as applicable, to the Administrative Agent:

     (i) with respect to the Foreign Security Documents, such amendments duly executed and acknowledged by the applicable Credit Parties as may be requested by the Administrative Agent in order to preserve and protect the validity of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent pursuant to such Foreign Security Documents;

     (ii) with respect to each Mortgage in favor of the Collateral Agent with respect to any U.S. Mortgaged Property, an amendment (each, a “Mortgage Amendment”) duly executed and acknowledged by the applicable Credit Party in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and providing that, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the applicable mortgagor secured by such Mortgage include a

guaranty by such mortgagor of all Obligations of the Bermuda Borrower under this Agreement;

     (iii) with respect to each Mortgage Amendment, an endorsement or other modification to the existing Mortgage Policy providing assurance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent that the lien on such Mortgaged Property in favor of the Collateral Agent shall continue to have the enforceability and priority in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of Amendment 1;

     (iv) with respect to each Mortgage Amendment, opinions of counsel to the Credit Parties covering customary matters and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent;

     (v) with respect to each U.S. Mortgaged Property requested by the Collateral Agent, a completed “Life-of-Loan” Federal Emergency Management Agency Standard Flood Hazard Determination (together with a notice about special flood hazard area status and flood disaster assistance duly executed by the applicable Credit Parties); and

     (vi) a copy of, or a certificate as to coverage under, the insurance policies required by Section 8.03 in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

If following a change in the relevant sections of the Code or the regulations, rules, rulings, notices or other official pronouncements issued or promulgated thereunder, counsel for the U.S. Borrower reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders does not within 30 days after a request from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders deliver evidence, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, that (i) a pledge of 66-2/3% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Equity Interests entitled to vote of any Foreign Unrestricted Subsidiary owned by a U.S. Credit Party which has not already had all of its Equity Interests pledged pursuant to the U.S. Pledge Agreement or a Local Law Pledge Agreement, as applicable, to secure all of the Obligations (as defined in the respective such Security Document), (ii) the entering into by a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor of a pledge agreement in substantially the form of the U.S. Pledge Agreement, (iii) the entering into by a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor of a security agreement in substantially the form of the U.S. Security Agreement and (iv) the entering into by a Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor of a guaranty in substantially the form of the U.S. Subsidiaries Guaranty, in any such case would cause the undistributed earnings of such Foreign Subsidiary as determined for Federal income tax purposes to be treated as a deemed dividend to such Foreign Subsidiary’s United States parent or a deemed disposition of the shares of stock of such Foreign Subsidiary for Federal income tax purposes, then (I) in the case of a failure to deliver the evidence described in clause (i) above, that portion of such Foreign Unrestricted Subsidiary’s outstanding Equity Interests owned or held by a U.S. Credit Party and not theretofore pledged pursuant to the U.S. Pledge Agreement or a Local Law Pledge Agreement, as applicable, to secure all of the Obligations (as defined in the respective such Security Document) shall be pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors pursuant to the U.S. Pledge Agreement or the relevant Local Law Pledge Agreement (or another pledge agreement in substantially similar form, if needed), (II) in the case of a failure to deliver the evidence described in clause (ii) above, such Foreign Subsidiary Guarantor shall

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8.12, no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.12 if the tax advisors for the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary determine that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Foreign Subsidiary is, or has ever been, a passive foreign investment company within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code.

          8.13 Use of Proceeds. The U.S. Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use the proceeds of the Loans for the purposes specified in Section 7.05.

          (d) The consummation of each Permitted Acquisition shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by each Credit Agreement Party that the certifications by each Credit Agreement Party (or by one or more of its respective Authorized Officers) pursuant to Section 8.15 are true and correct and that all conditions thereto have been satisfied and that same is permitted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which representation and warranty shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty for all purposes hereunder, including, without limitation, Sections 6 and 10.

          8.16 Maintenance of Company Separateness. Each Credit Agreement Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, satisfy customary Company formalities, including the holding of regular board of directors’ and shareholders’ meetings or action by directors or shareholders without a meeting and the maintenance of Company records. Neither the U.S. Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall make any payment to a creditor of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary in respect of any liability of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, and no bank account of any Non-

-91-





 





Guarantor Subsidiary shall be commingled with any bank account of the U.S. Borrower or any other Credit Party. Any financial statements distributed to any creditors of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary shall clearly establish or indicate the corporate separateness of such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary from the U.S. Borrower and its other Subsidiaries. Finally, neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action, or conduct its affairs in a manner, which is likely to result in the Company existence of any Credit Agreement Party, any other Credit Party or any Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries being ignored, or in the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Borrower or any other Credit Party being substantively consolidated with those of any other such Person or any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary in a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.

          8.17 Performance of Obligations. Each Credit Agreement Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, perform all of its obligations under the terms of each mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, loan agreement or credit agreement and each other material agreement, contract or instrument by which it is bound, except such non-performances as, individually or in the aggregate, have not caused, and could not reasonably be expected to cause, a Default or Event of Default hereunder or a Material Adverse Effect.

          8.18 Conduct of Business. (a) The Credit Agreement Parties shall take all actions so that, at all times from and after the Initial Borrowing Date, all the assets of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries located within the United States, all Equity Interests in all Domestic Subsidiaries or other U.S. Persons and all or substantially all of the business of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries conducted in the United States, are, in each case, owned or conducted, as the case may be, by the U.S. Borrower and one or more Qualified U.S. Obligors which are not direct or indirect Subsidiaries of any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower which is a Foreign Subsidiary, provided that if a Foreign Subsidiary (not itself created or established in contemplation of a Permitted Acquisition) is acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition which Foreign Subsidiary has (either directly or through one or more Domestic Subsidiaries) assets or operations in the United States, the U.S. Borrower shall have a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 60 days) to effect the transfer of U.S. assets and operations (including all Equity Interests in any Domestic Subsidiaries or other U.S. Persons held by it) of the respective Foreign Subsidiary to one or more Qualified U.S. Obligors, provided, further, that the respective transfer shall not be required to be made if the U.S. Borrower in good faith determines that such transfer would give rise to adverse tax consequences to the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries or would give rise to any material breach or violation of law or contract (in which case, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall transfer such assets and operations at such time, if any, as such adverse tax consequences or breach or violation would not exist and, until such time, shall use good faith efforts so that any growth in the assets or operations of the entity so acquired, to the extent located in the United States, are made within one or more Qualified U.S. Obligors).

          In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Credit Agreement Parties shall take all actions so that, at all times from and after the Initial Borrowing Date, all the assets of the U.S. Borrower’s Subsidiaries located within all Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdictions, all Equity Interests in all Persons organized under any Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction and all or substantially all of the business of the U.S. Borrower’s Subsidiaries conducted in all Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdictions, are, in each case, owned or conducted, as the case may be, by one or more Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors which are not direct or indirect Subsidiaries of any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower other than Qualified Obligors, provided that if a Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than any Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction (not itself created

-92-





 





or established in contemplation of the respective Permitted Acquisition) is acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition which Subsidiary has (either directly or through one or more Subsidiaries) assets or operations outside Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdictions, the U.S. Borrower shall have a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 60 days) to effect the transfer of all assets and operations outside Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdictions (including all Equity Interests in any Persons held by it which are organized under the laws of one or more Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdiction) of the respective Subsidiary to one or more Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors which are not themselves direct or indirect Subsidiaries of any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower other than Qualified Obligors, provided, further, that the respective transfer shall not be required to be made if the U.S. Borrower in good faith determines that such transfer would give rise to adverse tax consequences to the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries or would give rise to any material breach or violation of law or contract (in which case, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall transfer such assets and operations at such time, if any, as such adverse tax consequences or breach or violation would not exist, and until such time shall use good faith efforts so that any growth in the assets or operations of the entity so acquired, to the extent located in the Qualified Non-U.S. Jurisdictions, are made within one or more Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors which are not themselves direct or indirect Subsidiaries of any Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower other than Qualified Obligors). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.18(b), the ownership of the Bermuda Partnership (a Subsidiary which is not a Qualified Non-U.S. Obligor) of Equity Interests of Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors shall not be taken account of for purposes of determining compliance with this Section 8.18(b), so long as the Credit Agreement Parties and their respective Foreign Subsidiaries are at all times in compliance with Section 8.18(c) below.

          (b) The Credit Agreement Parties shall take all actions so that all Foreign Subsidiaries that are not Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors are directly or indirectly owned by one or more Qualified Non-U.S. Obligors (or, in the case of the Bermuda Partnership, is owned by the Bermuda Partnership Partners).

          (c) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.18 shall not prohibit the acquisition of, or Investments in, Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries as contemplated by Section 9.11(b), provided that the Equity Interest owned by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in such Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, to the extent organized under the laws of any Qualified Jurisdiction, shall be subject to the requirements of preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 8.18.

          8.19 Margin Stock. Each Credit Agreement Party shall take all actions so that at all times the aggregate value of all Margin Stock (other than treasury stock) owned by the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries (for such purpose, using the initial purchase price paid by the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary for the respective shares of Margin Stock) shall not exceed $10,000,000. So long as the aggregate value of Margin Stock (other than treasury stock) owned by the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries (determined as provided in the preceding sentence) does not exceed $10,000,000, all Margin Stock at any time owned by the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall not constitute Collateral and no security interest shall be granted therein pursuant to any Credit Document. Without excusing any violation of the first sentence of this Section 8.19, if at any time the aggregate value of all Margin Stock (other than treasury stock) owned by the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries (determined as provided in the first sentence of this Section 8.19) exceeds $10,000,000, then (x) all Margin Stock owned by the Credit Parties

-93-





 





(except to the extent constituting Excluded Collateral) shall be pledged, and delivered for pledge, pursuant to the relevant Security Documents and (y) the U.S. Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lenders appropriate completed forms (including, without limitation, Forms G-3 and U-1, as appropriate) establishing compliance with the Margin Regulations. If at any time any Margin Stock is required to be pledged as a result of the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, repayments of outstanding Obligations shall be required to be made, and subsequent Credit Events shall only be permitted, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Margin Regulations.

          8.20 Foreign Security Document Amendments. (x) If any additional Foreign Security Document is entered into by the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the Restatement Effective Date or (y) any change in applicable law governing any Foreign Security Document relevant to the scope of the Obligations covered by such Foreign Security Document or the Secured Creditors entitled to the benefits of such Foreign Security Document occurs after the Restatement Effective Date and, in any such case, the Collateral Agent (based on the advice of local counsel) has determined that amendments to the respective Foreign Security Document are required to maintain a valid and enforceable first priority lien on the Collateral covered by such Foreign Security Document in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of all of the Secured Creditors securing all of the relevant Obligations (i.e., all Tranche C Term Loans, all Bermuda Borrower Letters of Credit and Unpaid Drawings thereunder, all Bermuda Borrower Bank Guaranties and Unreimbursed Payments thereunder, and, after a given Incremental Term Loan Commitment Date, all related incremental Obligations resulting from the provision of the respective Incremental Term Loan Commitments to the Bermuda Borrower), then, within 90 days following the request of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, the U.S. Borrower shall duly authorize, execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent, or cause to be duly authorized, executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, a fully executed counterpart of an amendment to such Foreign Security Document, which amendment shall (i) be in full force and effect (and, if applicable, properly recorded) no later than the date of required execution and delivery of such amendment as provided above and (ii) otherwise be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          Section 9. Negative Covenants. Each Credit Agreement Party hereby covenants and agrees that as of the Restatement Effective Date and thereafter for so long as this Agreement is in effect and until the Total Commitment has terminated, no Letters of Credit, Bank Guaranties or Notes are outstanding and the Loans, together with interest, Fees and all other Obligations (other than any indemnities described in Section 13.13 which are not then due and payable) incurred hereunder, are paid in full:

          12.07 Indemnification. (a) To the extent any Agent (or any affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Credit Agreement Parties, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify such Agent (and any affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective “percentages” as used in determining the Required Lenders (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders and at the time such indemnity is sought), for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by such Agent (or any affiliate thereof) in performing its respective duties hereunder or under any other Credit

          (b) Any Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Credit Document (except actions expressly required to be taken by it hereunder or under the Credit Documents) unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

          (c) The agreements in this Section 12.07 shall survive the payment of all Obligations.

          12.09 Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person or entity who, at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

-197-





 





LESS IT IS TAKEN WITH THE CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR APPROVED IN WRITING BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, IF SUCH SETOFF OR ACTION OR PROCEEDING WOULD OR MIGHT (PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 580a, 580b, 580d AND 726 OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OR SECTION 2924 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, IF APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE) AFFECT OR IMPAIR THE VALIDITY, PRIORITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIENS GRANTED TO THE COLLATERAL AGENT PURSUANT TO THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS OR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND ANY ATTEMPTED EXERCISE BY ANY LENDER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OF ANY SUCH RIGHT WITHOUT OBTAINING SUCH CONSENT OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS SUBSECTION (b) SHALL BE SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EACH OF THE LENDERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREUNDER.

          13.03 Notices. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to any Credit Agreement Party, at the address specified opposite its signature below; if to any Lender, at its address specified for such Lender on Schedule II; and if to the Administrative Agent, at its Notice Office; or, as to any Credit Agreement Party or any of the Agents, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each Lender, at such other address as shall be designated by such Lender in a written notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and communications shall be mailed, telegraphed, telexed, telecopied or cabled or sent by overnight courier, and shall be effective when received.

          (b) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries to confirm in writing any telephonic notice permitted to be given hereunder, any Agent, any Issuing Lender (in the case of the issuance of a Letter of Credit) or any Bank Guaranty Issuer (in the case of the issuance of a Bank Guaranty), as the case may be, may prior to receipt of written confirmation act without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by such Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Bank Guaranty Issuer in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer. In each such case, the U.S. Borrower and each of the Borrowers hereby waive the right to dispute such Agent’s, or such Issuing Lender’s or such Bank Guaranty Issuer’s record of the terms of such telephonic notice.

          13.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no Credit Agreement Party may assign or transfer any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder or under any other Credit Document without the prior written consent of each of the Lenders and, provided, further, that, although any Lender may (without the consent of any Credit Party) transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any portion of its Commitments or Loans hereunder except as provided in Section 13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a “Lender” hereunder and, provided, further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participa-

tion under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except (I) to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note, Letter of Credit or Bank Guaranty (unless such Letter of Credit or Bank Guaranty is not extended beyond the CL Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post- default increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the participant’s participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment or of a mandatory repayment of Loans shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the participant’s participation is not increased as a result thereof and that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in any rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i), notwithstanding the fact that such amendment or modification actually results in such a reduction), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit Agreement Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided in the Security Documents) supporting the Obligations in which such participant is participating and (II) that, solely in the case of a participant (each, a “Voting Participant”) which (x) has purchased a participation interest in such Lender’s Commitments and/or outstanding Term Loans in a minimum aggregate amount (without duplication) of at least $2,000,000 on or after the Restatement Effective Date and (y) is (A) designated by such Lender to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent by written notice (a “Voting Participant Notice”) as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a “voting” participant hereunder, (B) approved by the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (C) not a Disqualified Voting Participant, such participant shall be entitled to vote with respect to each Tranche in which it holds a participation from such Lender (and the voting rights of such Lender for each such Tranche shall be correspondingly reduced), on a Dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender under such Tranche on any matter requiring or allowing such Lender to provide or withhold its consent or to otherwise vote on any proposed action (with any Voting Participant Notice, with respect to any Voting Participant, to be effective only if same (a) states the full legal name of such Voting Participant, as well as the relevant contact information and administrative details for such Voting Participant, and (b) states the Dollar amount of the participation interest in each Tranche purchased). In the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant’s rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; provided that a Voting Participant shall have the voting rights to which it is entitled as described in the preceding sentence.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its outstanding Term Loans and/or Credit-Linked Commitments (and related outstanding Obligations (and Credit-Linked Deposit, if applicable) hereunder) to (i) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company, (ii) one or more Lenders or (iii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank

-199-





 





loans, any other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same investment advisor of a Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at least (A) $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such outstanding principal amount of Term Loans hereunder and (B) $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning Lenders, of such Credit-Linked Commitments and related Credit-Linked Deposit and Obligations, in each case, to one or more Eligible Transferees (treating (I) any fund that in vests in bank loans and (II) any other fund that invests in bank loans and is managed by the same investment advisor as such fund or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor, as a single Eligible Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i) at such time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the outstanding Term Loans and/or Credit-Linked Commitments, as the case may be, of such new Lender and of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the request of the respective Lender and upon the surrender of the old Notes (if any), new Notes will be issued, at the Borrowers’ expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning Lender, such new Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05 (with appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, (iii) except in the case of assignments by the Agents in connection with their syndication of this Agreement, the consent of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and is continuing, the U.S. Borrower shall be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant to clause (y) of this Section 13.04(b) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iv) Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and, provided, further, that such transfer or assignment will not be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to Section 13.17. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments (and, in the case of an assignment of Credit-Linked Commitments, will lose its rights with respect to the assigned CL Percentage in its Credit-Linked Deposit) and/or outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall, to the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section 4.04(b)(ii) to the extent such forms would provide a complete exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax. To the extent that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender’s Commitments and related outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.13 or this Section 13.04(b) would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 1.11, 2A.06, 2B.06, or 4.04 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (altho ugh the Borrowers, in accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, at any time after the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment, if any Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties remain outstanding, assignments may be made as provided above, except that the respective assignment shall be of a portion of the respective CL Lender’s participation in Letters of Credit and Bank Guaranties (and

-200-





 





the related share of its Credit-Linked Deposit), although any such assignment effected after the termination of the Total Credit-Linked Commitment shall not release the assigning CL Lender from its obligations as a participant with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit or Bank Guaranties (although the respective assignee may agree, as between itself and the respective assigning CL Lender, that it shall be responsible for such amounts). The Credit-Linked Deposit funded by any CL Lender shall not be released in connection with any assignment of its Credit-Linked Commitment, but shall instead be purchased (to the extent of the CL Percentage so assigned) by the relevant assignee and continue to be held for application (if not already applied) pursuant to Section 2 in respect of such assignee’s obligations under the Credit-Linked Commitment assigned to it.

          (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or any Credit Agreement Party, any Lender which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Notes or Loans to its trustee or to a collateral agent or to another creditor providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations to such trustee, such Collateral Agent or a holder of, or any other representative of a holder of, such obligations, or such other creditor, as the case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute (by foreclosure or otherwise) any such pledge or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          13.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing between any Credit Party and any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of any Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

          13.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of any Credit Party in respect of any Obligations of such Credit Party, it shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, distribute such payment to the Lenders (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive its pro rata share of such payment) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.

          (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker’s lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans, Unpaid Drawings or Fees, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or

-201-





 





sums received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Credit Party to such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by all of the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the provisions of the preceding Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.

          13.07 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing by the U.S. Borrower to the Lenders), provided that (i) except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations determining the Excess Cash Flow, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio and compliance with Sections 4, 8.15 and 9, including in each case definitions used therein, shall, in each case, utilize United States accounting principles and policies in effect at the time of the preparation of, and in conformity with those used to prepare, the historical consolidated audited financial statements of the U.S. Borrower delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.10(b) for Fiscal Year 2004, (ii) to the extent expressly required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, certain calculations shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis and (iii) for purposes of determining compliance with any incurrence or expenditure tests set forth in Sections 8 and/or 9, any amounts so incurred or expended (to the extent incurred or expended in a currency other than Dollars) shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange rates (as shown on Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such exchange rates, on such other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) as in effect on the date of such incurrence or expenditure under any provision of any such Section that has an aggregate Dollar limitation provided for therein (and to the extent the respective incurrence or expenditure test regulates the aggregate amount outstanding at any time and it is expressed in terms of Dollars, all outstanding amounts originally incurred or spent in currencies other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange rates (as shown on Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such exchange rates, on such other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) as in effect on the date of any new incurrence or expenditures made under any provision of any such Section that regulates the Dollar amount outstanding at any time).

          (b) All computations of interest and Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or Fees are payable.

If for any reason such designee, appointee and agent shall cease to be available to act as such, each Credit Agreement Party agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in New York City on the terms and for the purposes of this provision reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Each Credit Agreement Party hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such courts lack jurisdiction over such Credit Agreement Party, and agrees not to plead or claim, in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that any such court lacks jurisdiction over such Credit Agreement Party. Each Credit Agreement Party further irrevocably consents to the service of process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Credit Agreement Party, as the case may be, at its address for notices pursuant to Section 13.03, such service to become effective 30 days after such mailing. Each Credit Agreement Party hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other Credit Document that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the holder of any Note to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Credit Agreement Party in any other jurisdiction.

          (b) EACH CREDIT AGREEMENT PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY OF THE AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (a) ABOVE AND HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

          13.10 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective (subject to the immediately succeeding sentence) on the date (the “Restatement Effective Date”) on which (i) each Credit Agreement Party, Original Lenders constituting the Original Required Lenders, each Consenting Tranche C Term Loan Lender, each Lender with a Tranche B Term Loan Commitment, each Lender with a Tranche C Term Loan Commitment, each Lender with a Credit-Linked Commitment, each Agent, each Issuing Lender of an Existing Letter of Credit, each Bank Guar anty Issuer of an Existing Bank Guaranty and the Lead Arranger shall have signed a counterpart hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered the same (including by way of facsimile transmission) to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the other conditions contained in Sections 5 and 6 are met to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the immediately preceding sentence, any amendments to the Original Credit Agreement effected pursuant to the amendment and restatement thereof on the Restatement Effective Date pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent requiring the consent of Original Lenders in excess of that required to meet the definition of Original Required Lenders, shall instead become effective on the Restatement Effective Date, but immediately after giving effect thereto (at which time 100% of the Lenders hereunder, after giving effect to the prepayments required on the Restatement Effective Date, shall provide such consents by their execution and delivery of copies hereof). Unless the Administrative Agent has received actual notice from any Lender that the conditions contained in Sections 5 and 6 have not been met to its satisfaction, upon the satisfaction of the condition described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence and upon the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that the conditions described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence have been met, then the Restatement Effective Date shall be deemed to have occurred, regardless of any subsequent determination that one or more of the conditions thereto had not been met (although the occurrence of the Restatement Effective Date shall not release any Credit Party from any liability for failure to satisfy one or more of the applicable conditions contained in Section 5 of the Original Credit Agreement or Section 6). The Administrative Agent will give each Credit Agreement Party and each Lender prompt written notice of the occurrence of the Restatement Effective Date.

          13.11 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections and subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

          (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of or to any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first proviso to Section 13.12(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the U.S. Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose individual consent is required are treated as described in either clause (A) or (B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (or, at the option of the U.S. Borrower if the respective Lender’s consent is required with respect to less than all Tranches (or related Commitments), to replace only the respective Tranche or Tranches of Commitments (and related Obligations and, if applicable, Credit-Linked Deposits) and/or Loans of the respective non-consenting Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such Lender’s individual consent) with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination or (B) terminate each Credit-Linked Commitment and/or Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such non-consenting Lender (if such Lender’s consent is required as a result of such Credit-Linked Commitment and/or Incremental Term Loan Commitment), and/or repay outstanding Obligations under each Tranche of such Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such Lender’s consent, in accordance with Sections 3.02(b) and/or 4.01, provided that, unless the

          (b) Each Credit Agreement Party hereby represents and acknowledges that, to the best of its knowledge, neither any Agent nor any Lender, nor any employees or agents of, or other persons affiliated with, any Agent or any Lender, have directly or indirectly made or provided any statement (oral or written) to such Credit Agreement Party or to any of its employees or agents, or other persons affiliated with or related to such Credit Agreement Party (or, so far as such Credit Agreement Party is aware, to any other person), as to the potential tax consequences of the Transaction.

          (c) Neither the Agents nor the Lenders provide accounting, tax or legal advice. Notwithstanding any express or implied claims of exclusivity or proprietary rights, each Credit Agreement Party, each Agent and each Lender hereby agree and acknowledge that each Credit Agreement Party, each Agent and each Lender (and each of their employees, representatives or other agents) are authorized to disclose to any and all persons, beginning immediately upon commencement of their discussions and without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other

Nothing herein is intended to imply that any of each Credit Agreement Party, each Agent and each Lender made or provided a statement, oral or written, to, or for the benefit of, any of each other as to any potential tax consequences that are related to, or may result from, the Transaction.

The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that each Credit Party shall be required to take all actions under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Credit Party is organized to create and perfect all security interests granted pursuant to the various Security Documents and to take all actions under the laws of each Qualified Jurisdiction to perfect the security interests in the Equity Interests of, and promissory notes issued by, any Person organized under the laws of said jurisdictions (in each case, to the extent said Equity Interests or promissory notes are owned by any Credit Party and do not constitute Excluded Collateral). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent any Security Document requires or provides for the pledge of promissory notes issued by, or Equity Interests in, any Person organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than those specified in the immediately preceding sentence, it is acknowledged that, as of the Restatement Effective Date, no actions have been required to be taken to perfect, under local law of the jurisdiction of the Person who issued the respective promissory notes or whose Equity Interests are pledged, under the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that, as of the Restatement Effective Date, no other amendments, modifications or supplements to the foregoing Foreign Security Documents under the laws of any jurisdiction to effect the intent in the foregoing sentence have occurred. The Credit Agreement Parties hereby agree that, within 90 days after the Restatement Effective Date (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent), each Credit Agreement Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take such actions (including, without limitation, amending, modifying or supplementing each such Foreign Security Document and the delivery of appropriate legal opinions) under the local law of any jurisdiction with respect to which such actions have not already been taken as are determined by the Administrative Agent or Required Lenders to be necessary or desirable in order to effect the foregoing amendments to each such Foreign Security Document.

If for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Credit Party in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency”) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made at the Dollar Equivalent thereof, and, in the case of other currencies, the rate of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative Agent) determined, in each case, as of the day on which the judgment is given (such day being hereinafter referred to as the “Judgment Currency Conversion Date”).

          (b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, such additional amounts, if any (but in any

          (c) For purposes of determining the Dollar Equivalent or any other rate of exchange for this Section 13.22, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase of the Obligation Currency.

No invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of all or any part of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or of any security therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty, and this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty shall be primary, absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense available to, a surety or guarantor except indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Credit Agreement Party hereunder are independent of the obligations of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any Credit Agreement Party whether or not action is brought against any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party and whether or not any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party be joined in any such action or actions. Each Credit Agreement Party waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof. Any payment by any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other circumstance that operates to toll any statute of limitations as to such Relevant Guaranteed Party shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to the relevant Credit Agreement Party.

          14.05 Authorization. Each Credit Agreement Party authorizes the Guaranteed Creditors without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to:

     (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and this

-217-





 





Credit Agreement Party Guaranty shall apply to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed, increased or altered;

     (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing, the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset thereagainst;

     (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;

     (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any Relevant Guaranteed Party or other obligors;

     (e) settle or compromise any of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to their respective creditors other than the Guaranteed Creditors;

     (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any liability or liabilities of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of such Relevant Guaranteed Party remain unpaid;

     (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement or Other Hedging Agreement or any of the instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Interest Rate Protection Agreement or Other Hedging Agreement or any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or

     (h) take any other action that would, under otherwise applicable principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of, or a defense available to, such Credit Agreement Party from its liabilities under this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty.

          14.06 Reliance. It is not necessary for the Guaranteed Creditors to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Relevant Guaranteed Party or the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any Relevant Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

          14.07 Subordination. Any of the indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party now or hereafter owing to any Credit Agreement Party is hereby subordinated to the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default exists, all such indebtedness of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to such Credit Agreement Party shall be collected, enforced and received by such Credit Agreement Party in trust for the benefit of the

-218-





 





Guaranteed Creditors and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors on account of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations of such Relevant Guaranteed Party to the Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of any Credit Agreement Party under the other provisions of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any Credit Agreement Party of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness of any Relevant Guaranteed Party to such Credit Agreement Party, such Credit Agreement Party shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Credit Agreement Party hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.

          14.08 Waiver. (a) Each Credit Agreement Party waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any other Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security held from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor’s power whatsoever. Each Credit Agreement Party waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Relevant Guaranteed Party other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Credit Agreement Party hereunder except to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Credit Agreement Party waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Credit Agreement Party against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other party or any security.

          Each Credit Agreement Party waives all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. Each Credit Agreement Party assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Relevant Guaranteed Party’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Credit Agreement Party assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise any Credit Agreement Party of information known to them regarding such circumstances or risks.

-219-





 





          (b) Until such time as the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full in cash, each Credit Agreement Party hereby waives all rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty.

          (c) Each U.S. Credit Agreement Party hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, such U.S. Credit Agreement Party shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing such U.S. Credit Agreement Party’s or any Guaranteed Creditor’s right to proceed against any Relevant Guaranteed Party or any other guarantor of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, each U.S. Credit Agreement Party hereby waives:

     (i) all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to such U.S. Credit Agreement Party by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil Procedure;

     (ii) all rights and defenses that such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have because the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from such U.S. Credit Agreement Party without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Credit Party, (1) the amount of the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may collect from such U.S. Credit Agreement Party even if the Guaranteed Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed any right such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have to collect from any Relevant Guaranteed Party, it being understood that this is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses such U.S. Credit Agreement Party may have because the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and

     (iii) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations, has destroyed such U.S. Credit Agreement Party’s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any Relevant Guaranteed Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise.

          (d) Each Credit Agreement Party warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.

          14.09 Payments. All payments made by a Credit Agreement Party pursuant to this Section 14 shall be made in the respective Applicable Currency in which the Relevant Guaranteed Obligations are then due and payable (giving effect, in the circumstances contemplated by Section 1.14, to any conversion occurring pursuant thereto). All payments made by a Credit Agreement Party pursuant to this Section 14 will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 4.03, 4.04 and 13.22.
