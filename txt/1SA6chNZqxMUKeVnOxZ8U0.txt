          WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the outstanding principal balance of the Note is $4,333,938.83 and the Note matured on November 30, 2009, at which time the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest became due and payable; and

          NOW THEREFORE, by mutual agreement of the parties and in consideration of the premises and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

          1. The Note is hereby amended as follows:



 

(a)

 

The maturity date shall be extended to November 28, 2010; and

          3. The parties intend that no novation has occurred with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by the Note.

 





 





          4. This Note Modification Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

          5. Power to Confess Judgment. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes any attorney-at-law, including an attorney employed by or retained and paid by the Bank, to appear in any court of record in or of the State of Ohio, or in any other state or territory of the United States, at any time after the loans or any of the other obligations evidenced by the Note become due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, to waive the issuing and service of process and to confess a judgment against the Borrower in favor of the Bank, and/or any assignee or holder hereof for the amount of such loans and any of such other obligations then appearing due from the Borrower under the Note and this Note Modification Agreement, together with costs of suit and thereupon to release all errors and waive all right of appeal or stays of execution in any court of record. The Borrower hereby expressly (i) waives any conflict of interest of the attorney(s) retained by the Bank to confess judgment against the Borrower upon the Note and this Note Modification Agreement, and (ii) consents to the receipt by such attorney(s) of a reasonable legal fee from the Bank for legal services rendered for confessing judgment against the Borrower upon the Note and this Note Modification Agreement. A copy of the Note and this Note Modification Agreement, certified by the Bank, may be filed in each such proceeding in place of filing the original as a warrant of attorney.
