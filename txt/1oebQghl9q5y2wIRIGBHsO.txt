(c)          Allocation of Registrable Securities.  The initial number of Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement and any increase in the number of Registrable Securities included therein shall be allocated pro rata among the Investors based on the number of Registrable Securities held by each Investor at the time the Registration Statement covering such initial number of Registrable Securities or increase thereof is declared effective by the SEC.  In the event that an Investor sells or otherwise transfers any of such Investor’s Registrable Securities, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the then remaining number of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement for such transferor.  Any shares of Common Stock included in a Registration Statement and which remain allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall be allocated to the remaining Investors, pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities then held by such Investors which are covered by such Registration Statement.  In no event shall the Company include any securities other than Registrable Securities on any Registration Statement without the prior written consent of the Required Holders or the Investor Representative. If the SEC requires that the Company register less than the amount of Registrable Securities originally included on any Registration Statement at the time it was filed, the Registrable Securities on such Registration Statement shall be decreased on a pro rata basis and, unless otherwise requested by an Investor, the Warrant Shares included on such Registration Statement shall be decreased first.

 

(d)         Sufficient Number of Shares Registered.  In the event the number of shares available under a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(a) is insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered by such Registration Statement or an Investor’s allocated portion of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2(c), the Company shall amend the applicable Registration Statement, or file a new Registration Statement (on Form S-3, if available), or both, so as to cover at least the Required Registration Amount as of the trading day immediately preceding the date of the filing of such amendment or new Registration Statement, in each case, as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after the necessity therefor arises.  The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment and/or new Registration Statement to become effective as soon as practicable following the filing thereof.  For purposes of the foregoing provision, the number of shares available under a Registration Statement shall be deemed “insufficient to cover all of the Registrable Securities” if at any time the number of shares of Common Stock available for resale under the Registration Statement is less than the product determined by multiplying (i) the Required Registration Amount as of such time by (ii) 0.90.

(e)         Effect of Failure to File and Obtain and Maintain Effectiveness of Registration Statement.  If: (i) a Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities required to be covered thereby and required to be filed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement is (A) not filed with the SEC on or before the respective Filing Deadline (a “Filing Failure”) or (B) not declared effective by the SEC on or before the respective Effectiveness Deadline or (ii) on any day after the Effective Date sales of all of the Registrable Securities required to be included on such Registration Statement cannot be made (other than during an Allowable Grace Period (as defined in Section 3(m)) pursuant to such Registration Statement or otherwise (including, without limitation, because of a failure to keep such Registration Statement effective, to disclose such information as is necessary for sales to be made pursuant to such Registration Statement, to register a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock or to maintain the listing of the Common Stock) (a “Maintenance Failure”) then, as liquidated damages (and in complete satisfaction and to the exclusion of any claims or remedies inuring to any holder of Registrable Securities) to any holder of Registrable Securities by reason of any such delay in or reduction of its ability to sell the underlying shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to each holder of Registrable Securities relating to such Registration Statement their pro rata portion (based on the amount of Registrable Securities held) an amount in cash) equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate Purchase Price (as such term is defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) of paid by the applicable Investor for the Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement on each of the following dates: (i) 20 days following the date of a Filing Failure; (ii) 20 days following the date of an Effectiveness Failure; (iii) 30 days following the initial day of a Maintenance Failure; (iv) on every thirtieth day after the day of a Filing Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Filing Failure is cured; (v) on every thirtieth day after the day of an Effectiveness Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Effectiveness Failure is cured; and (vi) on every thirtieth day after the initial day of a Maintenance Failure and thereafter (pro rated for periods totaling less than thirty days) until such Maintenance Failure is cured.  The payments to which a holder of Registrable Securities shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 2(f) are referred to herein as “Registration Delay Payments.”  Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Securities Purchase Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount of Registration Delay Payments exceed, in the aggregate, six percent (6%) of the aggregate Purchase Price paid by all Investors pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.

 

3.           Related Obligations.  At such time as the Company is obligated to file a Registration Statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 2(a), 2(d) or 2(e), the Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof and, pursuant thereto, the Company shall have the following obligations:

(b)        The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection with such Registration Statement, which prospectus is to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 promulgated under the 1933 Act, as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective at all times during the Registration Period, and, during such period, comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities of the Company covered by such Registration Statement until such time as all of such Registrable Securities shall have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof as set forth in such Registration Statement.

(d)         The Company shall notify the Investor Representative in writing of the happening of any event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a result of which the prospectus included in a Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided that in no event shall such notice contain any material, nonpublic information), and, subject to Section 3(m), promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement to correct such untrue statement or omission.  The Company shall also promptly notify the Investor Representative in writing when a prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and when a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment has become effective.

 

(e)         The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify the Investor Representative of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

(h)         The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts either to: (i) cause all of the Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be listed on each national securities exchange on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Company are then listed, if any, if the listing of such Registrable Securities is then permitted under the rules of such exchange.  The Company shall pay all fees and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this Section 3(h).

(c)         Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving a Claim, such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall, if a Claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 6, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume control of the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided, however, that an Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel with the fees and expenses of not more than one counsel for all such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party to be paid by the indemnifying party, if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the representation by such counsel of the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.  In the case of an Indemnified Person, legal counsel referred to in the immediately preceding sentence shall be selected by the Investors holding at least a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement to which the Claim relates.  The Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party in connection with any negotiation or defense of any such action or Claim by the indemnifying party and shall furnish to the indemnifying party all information reasonably available to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person which relates to such action or Claim.  The indemnifying party shall keep the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.  No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any action, claim or proceeding effected without its prior written consent, provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its consent.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or other compromise which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person of a release from all liability in respect to such Claim or litigation, and such settlement shall not include any admission as to fault on the part of the Indemnified Party.  Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms or corporations relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.  The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

 

(d)        The indemnification required by this Section 6 shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages are incurred.

 

(e)         The indemnity agreements contained herein shall be in addition to: (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person against the indemnifying party or others, and (ii) any liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.





 



12



 



7.           Contribution.  To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party agrees to make the maximum contribution with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that: (i) no Person involved in the sale of Registrable Securities which Person is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) in connection with such sale shall be entitled to contribution from any Person involved in such sale of Registrable Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds received by such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

 

8.           Reports Under the 1934 Act.  With a view to making available to the Investors the benefits of Rule 144 or any other similar rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit the Investors to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration, the Company agrees, for so long as Registrable Securities are outstanding, to:

 

(a)         make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

 

(b)         file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as the Company remains subject to such requirements and the filing of such reports and other documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

 

(c)         furnish to each Investor so long as such Investor owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, such information as may be reasonably and customarily requested to permit the Investors to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration.

 

9.           Assignment of Registration Rights.  The rights under this Agreement shall be automatically assignable by the Investors to any permitted transferee of all or any portion of such Investor’s Registrable Securities if: (i) the Investor agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to the Company within five (5) Business Days after such assignment; (ii) the Company is, within five (5) Business Days after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the name and address of such transferee or assignee, and (b) the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being transferred or assigned; (iii) immediately following such transfer or assignment the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted under the 1933 Act or applicable state securities laws; (iv) at or before the time the Company receives the written notice contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the provisions contained herein; and (v) such transfer shall have been made in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Purchase Agreement.

 

10.         Amendment of Registration Rights. Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance thereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only with the written consent of the Company and the Investor Representative who shall have obtained the consent of the Requisite Holders.  Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 10 shall be binding upon each Investor and the Company.  No such amendment shall be effective to the extent that it applies to less than all of the holders of the Registrable Securities.  No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement unless the same consideration also is offered to all of the parties to this Agreement.





 



13



 

 

11.         Miscellaneous.

 

(a)         A Person is deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns or is deemed to own of record such Registrable Securities.  If the Company receives conflicting instructions, notices or elections from two or more Persons with respect to the same Registrable Securities, the Company shall act upon the basis of instructions, notice or election received from such record owner of such Registrable Securities.

 

(b)         Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered if delivered in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Securities Purchase Agreement.

 

(c)         Failure of any party to exercise any right or remedy under this Agreement or otherwise, or delay by a party in exercising such right or remedy, shall not operate as a waiver thereof.

 

(d)         All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of the Transaction Documents shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 

(e)         Each party agrees that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Note (whether brought against a party hereto or its respective affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York.  Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, New York for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of this Note, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper.  Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Note and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner permitted by law.  EACH PARTY HERETO (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.





 



14



 

 

(f)   	   This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) and the instruments referenced herein and therein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.  There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein and therein.  This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the instruments referenced herein and therein supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

(g)         Subject to the requirements of Section 9, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the permitted successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto.

 

(h)         The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

 

(i)   	   This Agreement may be executed in identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.  This Agreement, once executed by a party, may be delivered to the other party hereto by facsimile transmission of a copy of this Agreement bearing the signature of the party so delivering this Agreement.

 

(j)    	  Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(k)         All consents and other determinations required to be made by the Investors pursuant to this Agreement shall be made, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, by the Investor Representative.

(m)        This Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and is not for the benefit of, nor may any provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.

 

(n)         The obligations of each Investor hereunder are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Investor, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any obligations on any Investor vis-à-vis any other Investor.  Nothing contained herein, and no action taken by any Investor pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Investors are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated herein.





 



15



 



(o)         The Lead Placement Agent and any co-placement agent are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and have all of the rights of an “Investor” under this Agreement and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued to the Lead Placement Agent and any co-placement agent (and any capital stock of the Company issued or issuable, with respect to the warrants issued to the Lead Placement Agent or any co-placement agent as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, exchange, anti-dilution adjustment or similar event or otherwise, without regard to any limitations on exercises of the warrants, if any) constitute Registrable Securities for all purposes of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Lead Placement Agent nor the co-placement agent are entitled to any Registration Delay Payments.
