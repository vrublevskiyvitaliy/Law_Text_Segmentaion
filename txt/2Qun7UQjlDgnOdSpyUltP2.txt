the Company to such officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives of the Advisor or the Company as it may deem appropriate. Any authority delegated by the Advisor to any other Person shall be subject to the limitations on the rights and powers of the Advisor specifically set forth in this Agreement or the Charter.

4.02 Powers of the Advisor.  Subject to the express limitations set forth in this Agreement and the continuing and exclusive authority of the Board over the management of the Company, the power to direct the management, operation and policies of the Company, including making, financing and disposing of investments, shall be vested in the Advisor, which shall have the power by itself and shall be authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Company to carry out any and all of the objectives and purposes of the Company and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings that it may in its sole discretion deem necessary, advisable or incidental thereto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

4.03 Approval by the Board.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Advisor may not take any action on behalf of the Company without the prior approval of the Board or duly authorized committees thereof if the Charter or Maryland General Corporation Law require the prior approval of the Board.

4.04 Modification or Revocation of Authority of Advisor.  The Board may, at any time upon the giving of notice to the Advisor, modify or revoke the authority or approvals set forth in Article 3 and this Article 4 hereof; provided, however, that such modification or revocation shall be effective upon receipt by the Advisor and shall not be applicable to investment transactions to which the Advisor has committed the Company prior to the date of receipt by the Advisor of such notification.

ARTICLE 5

BANK ACCOUNTS

The Advisor may establish and maintain one or more bank accounts in its own name for the account of the Company or in the name of the Company and may collect and deposit into any such account or accounts, and disburse from any such account or accounts, any money on behalf of the Company, under such terms and conditions as the Board may approve, provided that no funds shall be commingled with the funds of the Advisor.

RECORDS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Advisor, in the conduct of its responsibilities to the Company, shall maintain adequate and separate books and records for the Company’s operations in accordance with

Such books and records shall include all information necessary to calculate and audit the fees or reimbursements paid under this Agreement.

All financial statements that the Advisor delivers to the Company shall be prepared on an accrual basis in accordance with GAAP, except for special financial reports that by their nature require a deviation from GAAP. The Advisor shall liaise with the Company’s officers and independent auditors and shall provide such officers and auditors with the reports and other information that the Company so requests.

In the event an action that would violate (i) through (v) of the preceding sentence but such action has been ordered by the Board, the Advisor shall notify the Board of the Advisor’s judgment of the potential impact of such action and shall refrain from taking such action until it receives further clarification or instructions from the Board. In such event, the Advisor shall have no liability for acting in accordance with the specific instructions of the Board so given.

With respect to the acquisition of a Property or other Permitted Investment through any Joint Venture or any partnership in which the Company or the Partnership is, directly or

 

14



indirectly, a co-venturer or partner, the Acquisition Advisory Fee payable to the Advisor shall equal 1.0% of the portion of the amount actually paid or allocated to fund the acquisition, development, construction or improvement of the Property or other Permitted Investment, inclusive of the Acquisition Expenses associated with such Property or other Permitted Investment, plus the amount of any debt associated with, or used to fund the investment in, such Property or other Permitted Investment that is attributable to the Company’s investment in such Joint Venture or partnership plus budgeted capital improvement costs. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the payment of Acquisition Advisory Fees by the Company shall be subject to the limitations on Acquisition Fees contained in (and defined in) the Company’s Charter. The Advisor shall submit an invoice to the Company on or about the closing or closings of each acquisition, accompanied by a computation of the Acquisition Fee. Generally, the Acquisition Advisory Fee payable to the Advisor shall be paid at the closing of the transaction upon receipt of the invoice by the Company. However, the Acquisition Advisory Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All or any portion of the Acquisition Advisory Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine.

8.02 Development and Construction Fees.  If the Advisor or an Affiliate provides development services and/or construction services with respect to a Property, the Company shall pay the Advisor Development Fees and/or Construction Fees, as applicable, in amounts that are usual and customary for comparable services rendered to similar projects in the geographic market; provided, however, that the Conflict Committee must determine that such Development Fees and Construction Fees are fair and reasonable and on terms and conditions not less favorable than those available from unaffiliated third parties. Development Fees and Construction Fees will include the reimbursement of the specified cost incurred by the Advisor of engaging third parties for such services. However, the Development Fee and/or Construction Fee, as applicable, may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor.

8.03 Asset Management Fees.  The Company shall pay the Advisor as compensation for the services described in Section 3.03 hereof a monthly fee (the “Asset Management Fee”) in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 1.0% of the sum of the Cost of Real Estate Investments and the Cost of other Permitted Investments. The Advisor shall submit a monthly invoice to the Company, accompanied by a computation of the Asset Management Fee for the applicable period.

The payment of any Disposition Fees by the Company shall be subject to the limitations contained in the Company’s Charter. Any Disposition Fee payable under this Section 8.04 may be paid in addition to commissions paid to non-Affiliates, provided that the total commissions (including such Disposition Fee) paid to all Persons by the Company for each Sale shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 6% of the aggregate Contract Sales Price of each Property or other Permitted Investment or (ii) the Competitive Real Estate Commission for each Property or other Permitted Investment. The Advisor shall submit an invoice to the Company on or about the closing or closings of each disposition, accompanied by a computation of the Disposition Fee. Generally, the Disposition Fee payable to the Advisor shall be paid at the closing of the transaction upon receipt of the invoice by the Company. However, the Disposition Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor.

The Subscription Processing Fee is an Organization and Offering Expense of the Company and is subject to the limitations on Organization and Offering Expenses in Article 9 hereof.

8.06 Property Management Fees.  If the Company retains the Advisor or its Affiliates to manage any of its Properties, the Company will pay the Advisor or its Affiliates in amounts that are usual and customary for comparable services rendered to similar Properties in the geographic market; provided, however, that the Conflict Committee must determine that such Property Management Fees are fair and reasonable and on terms and conditions not less favorable than those available from unaffiliated third parties. Property Management Fees will include the reimbursement of the specified cost incurred by the Advisor of engaging third parties for such services. However, the Property Management Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All or any portion of the Property Management Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine. Notwithstanding the above, the Advisor may engage (on behalf of the Company) third parties to provide property management

 

16



services pursuant to its authority under Article 4 and pay such third parties all applicable Property Management Fees.

8.07 Subordinated Share of Cash Flows.  The Subordinated Share of Cash Flows shall be payable to the Advisor in an amount equal to 15% of Operating Cash Flow and Cash from Sales, Settlements and Financings remaining after the Stockholders have received Distributions of Operating Cash Flow and of Cash from Sales, Settlements and Financings such that the owners of all outstanding Shares have received Distributions in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of:

a.  the Stockholders’ 8% Return and

b.  Invested Capital.

When determining whether the above threshold has been met:

 

 

(A)

Any stock dividend shall not be included as a Distribution; and

 

 

(B)

Distributions paid on Shares redeemed by the Company (and thus no longer included in the determination of Invested Capital), shall not be included as a Distribution.

Following Listing, no Subordinated Share of Cash Flows will be paid to the Advisor.

If the Subordinated Share of Cash Flows is payable to the Advisor, the Advisor shall submit a monthly invoice to the Company, accompanied by a computation of the total amount of the Subordinated Share of Cash Flows for the applicable period. Generally, the Subordinated Share of Cash Flows payable to the Advisor shall be paid on the last day of such month, or the first business day following the last day of such month. However, the Subordinated Share of Cash Flows may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All or any portion of the Subordinated Share of Cash Flows not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine.

8.08 Subordinated Incentive Fee.  Upon Listing, the Advisor shall be entitled to the Subordinated Incentive Fee in an amount equal to 15% of the amount by which (i) the market value of the outstanding Shares of the Company, measured by taking the average closing price or the average of the bid and asked price, as the case may be, over a period of 30 days during which the Shares are traded, with such period beginning 180 days after Listing (the “Market Value”), plus the total of all Distributions paid to Stockholders (excluding any stock dividends) from the Company’s inception until the date that Market Value is determined, exceeds (ii) the sum of (A) 100% of Invested Capital and (B) the total Distributions required to be paid to the Stockholders in order to pay the Stockholders’ 8% Return from inception through the date Market Value is determined. The Company shall have the option to pay such fee in the form of cash, Shares, a promissory note or any combination of the foregoing. The Subordinated Incentive Fee will be reduced by the amount of any prior payment to the Advisor of a Subordinated Share of Cash Flows. In the event the Subordinated Incentive Fee is paid to the Advisor following Listing, no other performance fee will be paid to the Advisor. In addition, the Subordinated Incentive Fee

 

17



may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All or any portion of the Subordinated Incentive Fee not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine.

8.09 Changes to Fee Structure.  In the event of Listing, the Company and the Advisor shall negotiate in good faith to establish a fee structure appropriate for a perpetual-life entity.

ARTICLE 11

RELATIONSHIP OF ADVISOR AND COMPANY;

OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISOR

11.01 Relationship.  The Company and the Advisor are not partners or joint venturers with each other, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to make them such partners or joint venturers. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor from engaging in other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other

 

20



REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates. Nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any manager, director, officer, employee or equityholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other Person. The Advisor may, with respect to any investment in which the Company is a participant, also render advice and service to each and every other participant therein. The Advisor shall promptly disclose to the Conflicts Committee the existence of any condition or circumstance, existing or anticipated, of which it has knowledge, that creates or could create a conflict of interest between the Advisor’s obligations to the Company and its obligations to or its interest in any other Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Advisor shall promptly provide notice to the Conflicts Committee if the Advisor and Legacy Partners Residential Realty, LLC propose, after the date of this Agreement, to create any additional exclusion from the restrictions on competing business activities set forth in Section 8.1(a) of the operating agreement of KBS-Legacy Apartment Community REIT Venture, LLC. Such notice shall include a detailed description of the proposed exclusion and the basis for the determination by the Advisor and Legacy Partners Residential Realty, LLC that the excluded activity is not competitive with the Company or its investments. Within a reasonable time following its receipt of such notice, the Conflicts Committee shall approve or reject (by majority vote) the proposed exclusion.

11.02 Time Commitment.  The Advisor shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the Advisor and its Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents may also engage in activities unrelated to the Company and may provide services to Persons other than the Company or any of its Affiliates.

11.03 Investment Opportunities and Allocation.  The Advisor shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to present a continuing and suitable investment program to the Company that is consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company.

ARTICLE 12

THE KBS NAME

The Advisor and its Affiliates have a proprietary interest in the name “KBS.” The Advisor hereby grants to the Company a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive royalty-free right and license to use the name “KBS” during the term of this Agreement. Accordingly, and in recognition of this right, if at any time the Company ceases to retain the Advisor or one of its Affiliates to perform advisory services for the Company, the Company will, promptly after receipt of written request from the Advisor, cease to conduct business under or use the name “KBS” or any derivative thereof and the Company shall change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name “KBS” or any other word or words that might, in the reasonable discretion of the Advisor, be susceptible of indication of some form of relationship between the Company and the Advisor or any its Affiliates. At such time, the Company will also make any changes to any trademarks, servicemarks or other marks necessary to remove any references to the word “KBS.” Consistent with the foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Advisor or one or more of its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for investment in real estate) and financial and service organizations having “KBS” as a part of their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to object thereto) by the Company.
