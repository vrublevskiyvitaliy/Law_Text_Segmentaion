Section 2.1            Credit Facility.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Lenders agree to make available a credit facility for use by any one or more of the Borrowers from time to time during the term of this Agreement (the “Credit Facility”).  The Credit Facility shall be composed of a revolving credit facility consisting of Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit as described in Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 and a term loan facility consisting of Term Loans as described in Section 2.3.

 

Section 2.2            Revolving Loans.

 

(a)           Amounts.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Revolving Lender severally, but not jointly, agrees, upon a Borrower’s request from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Original Closing Date to the Revolving Termination Date, to make revolving loans (the “Revolving Loans”) to the

 

43







 

Borrowers in amounts not to exceed such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Credit Commitments.  The Lenders, however, in their unanimous discretion, may elect to make Revolving Loans that would cause the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings to exceed the Borrowing Base on one or more occasions, but if they do so, neither the Agents nor the Lenders shall be deemed thereby to have changed the limits of the Borrowing Base or to be obligated to exceed such limits on any other occasion.  If any requested Revolving Loan exceeds the Unused Availability then the Revolving Lenders may refuse to make or may otherwise restrict the making of such Revolving Loan, subject to the authority of the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, to make Agent Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(j).

 

(b)           [Intentionally Omitted.]

 

(c)           Procedure for Borrowing.

 

(i)            Each Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be made upon a Borrower’s irrevocable written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent, in the form of a notice of borrowing in the form of Exhibit D or such other form as may be acceptable to the Agents in their sole discretion (any such notice being referred to herein as a “Notice of Borrowing”), which must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York time) (y) three Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, in the case of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans or (z) on the requested Funding Date, in the case of Base Rate Revolving Loans, specifying:

 

(A)                              the amount of the Borrowing, which in the case of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans shall be in an amount that is not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in excess thereof;

 

(B)                                the requested Funding Date, which must be a Business Day;

 

(C)                                whether the Revolving Loans requested are to be Base Rate Revolving Loans or LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans; provided that if such Borrower fails to specify whether any Revolving Loans are to be Base Rate Revolving Loans or LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, such request shall be deemed a request for Base Rate Revolving Loans;

 

(D)                               if the requested Revolving Loans are to be LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, the duration of the Interest Period; provided that if such Borrower fails to select the duration of the Interest Period with respect to any requested LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested such Revolving Loans be made as LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans with an Interest Period of one month in duration; and

 

(E)                                 whether the proceeds of such Borrowing are to be deposited to the Funding Account or sent by wire transfer to a third party,

 

44



 





 

in which case such Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with written wire transfer instructions satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;

 

provided that with respect to the Borrowing to be made on the Original Closing Date, such Borrowing will consist of Base Rate Revolving Loans only.

 

(ii)           With respect to any request for Base Rate Revolving Loans, in lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing, a Borrower may give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice of such request for advances to the Funding Account not later than the required time specified in clause (i) preceding.  The Administrative Agent at all times shall be entitled to rely on such telephonic notice in making any such Revolving Loans, regardless of whether any written confirmation is received by it.

 

(iii)          Whenever checks or other items are presented to BofA for payment against the Funding Account or any other Deposit Account maintained by a Borrower with BofA in an amount greater than the then available balance in the Funding Account or such other Deposit Account, such presentation may, at the election of the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, be deemed to be a request by the Borrowers for a Base Rate Revolving Loan on the date of such presentation in an amount sufficient to cover all such items presented in the Funding Account or such other Deposit Account on such date.

 

(iv)          At the election of either of the Agents or the Majority Revolving Lenders, the Borrowers shall have no right to request LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans during the existence of any Default or Event of Default.

 

(d)           Disbursement.  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a notice setting forth the deposit account maintained with BofA (the “Funding Account”) to which the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers to transfer the proceeds of the Revolving Loans requested hereunder.  Each of the Borrowers agrees that the Funding Account may be established in the name of any other Borrower, and hereby agrees that the Funding Account has been established for the benefit of all of the Borrowers for receipt of the proceeds of Revolving Loans hereunder.  Each Borrower hereby appoints each other Borrower as its agent with respect to receipt of the proceeds of Revolving Loans in the Funding Account as contemplated herein.  The Borrowers may designate a replacement Funding Account from time to time by written notice to the Administrative Agent.  Any designation by the Borrowers of the Funding Account must be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

 

(e)           Reliance Upon Authority; No Liability.  The Administrative Agent is entitled to rely conclusively on any individual’s request for Revolving Loans on behalf of a Borrower, as long as the proceeds thereof are to be transferred to the Funding Account or according to such other instructions as may be provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i)(E).  The Administrative Agent has no duty to verify the identity of any individual representing himself or herself as a person authorized by any

 

45







 

Borrower to make such requests on its behalf.  The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability to the Borrowers as a result of acting upon any notice referred to in Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(d) which the Administrative Agent reasonably believes to have been given by an officer or other person duly authorized by a Borrower to request Revolving Loans on its behalf or for otherwise acting under this Section 2.2.  The crediting of Revolving Loans to the Funding Account or wire transfer to such Person as a Borrower shall direct shall conclusively establish the obligation of the Borrowers to repay such Revolving Loans as provided herein.

 

(f)            Notice Irrevocable.  Any Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) made pursuant to Section 2.2(c) shall be irrevocable and the Borrowers shall be bound to borrow the funds requested therein in accordance therewith.

 

(g)           Administrative Agent’s Election.  Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof), the Administrative Agent shall elect in its sole discretion to have the terms of Section 2.2(h), Section 2.2(i), or Section 2.2(j) apply to such requested Borrowing.  If BofA declines in its sole discretion to make a Non-Ratable Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(i), the terms of Section 2.2(h) shall apply to the requested Borrowing unless such requested Borrowing is to be made by the Administrative Agent as an Agent Advance pursuant to Section 2.2(j).

 

(h)           Making of Revolving Loans.  If the Administrative Agent elects to have the terms of this Section 2.2(h) apply to a requested Borrowing, then promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing or telephonic notice in lieu thereof, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or e-mail of the requested Borrowing.  Each Revolving Lender shall transfer its Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, to the account from time to time designated by the Administrative Agent not later than 3:30 p.m. (New York time) on the applicable Funding Date.  After receipt by the Administrative Agent of all proceeds of such requested Borrowing, it shall make the proceeds of such requested Borrowing available to the applicable Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to the Funding Account or as otherwise requested by such Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i)(E).  Unless the Revolving Lenders in their unanimous discretion consent otherwise, no Borrowing under this clause (h) shall be permitted if the requested Borrowing exceeds the Unused Availability on the applicable Funding Date prior to giving effect to such requested Borrowing.

 

(i)            Making of Non-Ratable Loans.  If the Administrative Agent elects, with the consent of BofA, in its capacity as a Revolving Lender, to have the terms of this Section 2.2(i) apply to a requested Borrowing, BofA shall make a Revolving Loan in the amount of such requested Borrowing available to the Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to the Funding Account or as otherwise requested by the applicable Borrower in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i)(E).  Each Revolving Loan made solely by BofA pursuant to this Section 2.2(i) is referred to hereinafter as a “Non-Ratable Loan,” and such Revolving Loans are collectively referred to as the “Non-Ratable Loans.”  Each Non-Ratable Loan shall be subject to all the terms

 

46







 

and conditions applicable to other Revolving Loans except that all payments of principal and interest thereon shall be payable to BofA solely for its own account.  The aggregate amount of Non-Ratable Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed $10,000,000.  The Administrative Agent shall not request BofA to make any Non-Ratable Loan if (A) the Administrative Agent has received written notice from any Revolving Lender that one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing or (B) the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge (based solely on the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered to it or written notice from any Revolving Lender thereof) that the requested Borrowing exceeds the Unused Availability on the applicable Funding Date prior to giving effect to such requested Borrowing.  The Non-Ratable Loans shall be secured by the Agent’s Liens in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Base Rate Revolving Loans and Obligations hereunder.

 

(j)            Agent Advances.  Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in its sole discretion in such capacity, after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default or at any time that any of the other conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 have not been satisfied, to make Base Rate Revolving Loans to the Borrowers or any Borrower on behalf of the Revolving Lenders in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed $10,000,000 which the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (i) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations (including through the Borrowers using any proceeds of such Revolving Loans to pay payroll and associated tax obligations), or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 15.7 (any of such advances are herein referred to as “Agent Advances”); provided that after giving effect to the making of any Agent Advance, the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings shall not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount.  The Majority Revolving Lenders may at any time revoke the authorization of the Administrative Agent to make Agent Advances.  Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent thereof.  The Agent Advances shall be secured by the Agent’s Liens in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Base Rate Revolving Loans and Obligations hereunder.

 

Section 2.3            Term Loans.

 

(a)           Amounts of Term Loans.  Each Term Lender severally agrees to make a term loan (any such term loan being referred to as a “Term Loan” and such term loans being referred to collectively as the “Term Loans”) to the Borrowers on the Closing Date, upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 9, in an amount equal to such Term Lender’s Term Loan Commitment.  A portion of the Term Loan of each Term Lender to be made on the Closing Date shall be made as new funds to the Borrowers in the amount set forth beside such Term Lender’s name under the heading “New Term Loan Funding Amount” on Schedule 1.1(A) (such amount for any Term Lender, its “New Term Loan Funding Amount”), with the remaining portion of the Term

 

47







 

Loan of such Term Lender to be made on the Closing Date (such portion for any Term Lender, its “Exchanged Term Loan Amount”) to be deemed made as an exchange for cancellation of certain of the Second Lien Debt held by such Term Lender immediately prior to such Borrowing (the amount of such Second Lien Debt of any Term Lender to be so cancelled to be equal to such Term Lender’s Exchanged Term Loan Amount multiplied by 4/3).

 

(b)           Making of Term Loans.  Each Term Lender shall make the amount of such Term Lender’s New Term Loan Funding Amount available to the Administrative Agent in same day funds, to the Administrative Agent’s designated account, not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on the Closing Date.  After the Administrative Agent’s receipt of the New Term Loan Funding Amounts of all the Term Lenders, upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Article 9, the Administrative Agent shall make such amounts available to the Borrowers on such Funding Date by transferring same day funds equal to the aggregate New Term Loan Funding Amounts received by the Administrative Agent to a Clearing Account designated in writing by the Borrowers or as the Borrowers shall otherwise instruct in writing.

 

(c)           Term Loan Notes.  The Borrowers shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent on behalf of each Term Lender, on the Closing Date, a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof (such promissory notes, together with any new promissory notes issued pursuant to Section 13.2 upon the assignment of any portion of any Term Lender’s Term Loan, being hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Term Loan Notes” and each of such promissory notes being hereinafter referred to individually as a “Term Loan Note”). The Term Loan Notes shall evidence each Term Lender’s Term Loan, in an original principal amount equal to that Term Lender’s Term Loan Commitment and with other appropriate insertions. Each Term Loan Note shall be dated the Closing Date and be stated to mature on the Stated Term Loan Termination Date.  The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans, plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the Term Loan Termination Date.  Payments or prepayments of the Term Loans may not be reborrowed.  The liability of the Borrowers with respect to the Term Loans shall be joint and several.

(a)           Agreement to Cause to Issue.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Agents agree to cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue for the account of any of the Borrowers (whether one or more) one or more commercial/documentary and standby letters of credit (each a “Letter of Credit” and collectively, the “Letters of Credit”) from time to time prior to the Revolving Termination Date.

 

(b)           Amounts; Outside Expiration Date.  The Agents shall not cause to be issued any Letter of Credit at any time if:  (i) the maximum face amount of the requested Letter of Credit is greater than the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility at such time; (ii) the maximum undrawn amount of the requested Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges due from such Borrower in connection with the opening thereof

(c)           Other Conditions.  In addition to being subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent contained in Article 9, the obligation of the Agents to cause any Letter of Credit to be issued is subject to the following conditions precedent having been satisfied in a manner satisfactory to the Agents and the Letter of Credit Issuer:

 

(i)            the Borrowers shall have delivered to the Letter of Credit Issuer, at such times and in such manner as the Letter of Credit Issuer may prescribe, an application in form and substance satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuer and reasonably satisfactory to each Agent for the issuance of the Letter of Credit and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof, and the form, terms, and purpose of the proposed Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory to each Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer (provided that in the event any term of such application or any other document is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Letter of Credit Issuer is either the same Person as an Agent or any Revolving Lender, then the terms of this Agreement shall be controlling); and

(i)            Request for Issuance.  Any Borrower that wishes to cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall notify each Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer of such request for issuance at least three Business Days prior to the proposed issuance date.  Such notice shall be irrevocable and must specify the original face amount of the Letter of Credit requested, the Business Day of issuance of such requested Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit may be drawn in a single or in partial draws, the Business Day on which the requested

 

49







 

Letter of Credit is to expire, the purpose for which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, and the beneficiary of the requested Letter of Credit.  The applicable Borrower shall attach to such notice the proposed form of the Letter of Credit.

 

(ii)           Responsibilities of the Agents; Issuance.  As of the Business Day immediately preceding the requested issuance date of the Letter of Credit set forth in the notice from a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3(d)(i), the Agents shall determine (A) the amount of the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility and (B) the Unused Availability (based solely on the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered to the Agents).  If the face amount of the requested Letter of Credit is not greater than the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility (prior to giving effect to issuance of such requested Letter of Credit) and the amount of such requested Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges due from the Borrower in connection with the opening thereof do not exceed the Unused Availability (prior to giving effect to issuance of such requested Letter of Credit and based solely on the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered to the Agents), the Agents shall cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue the requested Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date if the other conditions hereof and of the application for such requested Letter of Credit are met.

 

(iii)          Extensions and Amendments.  The Agents shall not be obligated to cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to extend, renew, or amend any Letter of Credit issued pursuant hereto unless the requirements of this Section 2.4 are met as though a new Letter of Credit were being requested and issued.  With respect to any Letter of Credit that contains any “evergreen” or automatic renewal provision, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have consented to any such extension or renewal unless such Revolving Lender shall have provided to each Agent written notice that such Revolving Lender declines to consent to any such extension or renewal at least 30 days prior to the date on which the Letter of Credit Issuer is entitled to decline to extend or renew such Letter of Credit; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if all of the requirements of this Section 2.4 are met and no Default or Event of Default exists, no Revolving Lender may decline to consent to any such extension or renewal.

 

(e)           Payments Pursuant to Letters of Credit.  The Borrowers agree to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer immediately for any draw under any Letter of Credit and to pay the Letter of Credit Issuer the amount of all other charges and fees payable to the Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit immediately when due, irrespective of any claim, setoff, defense, or other right that any Borrower may have at any time against the Letter of Credit Issuer or any other Person.  Each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a request by the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued for a Borrowing of a Base Rate Revolving Loan in the amount of such drawing.  The Funding Date with respect to such Borrowing shall be the date of such drawing.

 

50







 

(f)            Indemnification; Exoneration; Power of Attorney.

 

(i)            Indemnification.  In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere provided in this Section 2.4, each Borrower agrees to protect, indemnify, pay, and save the Revolving Lenders, the Agents, and the Letter of Credit Issuer harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that any Revolving Lender, either Agent, or the Letter of Credit Issuer may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit.  The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to the Letter of Credit Issuer to the extent of any wrongful honor or dishonor of a drawing against any Letter of Credit or to the extent of any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Issuer as determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The Borrowers’ obligations under this Section 2.4(f) shall survive payment of all other Obligations.

 

(ii)           Assumption of Risk by the Borrowers.  As among the Borrowers, the Revolving Lenders, the Agents, and the Letter of Credit Issuer, the Borrowers assume all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of any of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Revolving Lenders, the Agents, and the Letter of Credit Issuer shall not be responsible for:  (A) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness, or legal effect of any document submitted by any Person in connection with the application for and issuance of and presentation of drafts with respect to any of the Letters of Credit, even if it should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent, or forged; (B) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) the failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply duly with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (D) errors, omissions, interruptions, or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (E) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (F) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (G) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; (H) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of any of the Revolving Lenders, either of the Agents, or the Letter of Credit Issuer, including any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental Authority; or (I) the Letter of Credit Issuer’s honor of a draw for which the draw or any certificate fails to comply in any respect with the terms of the Letter of Credit.  None of the foregoing shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any rights or powers of either Agent, any Revolving Lender, or, subject to Section 2.4(f)(iv), the Letter of Credit Issuer under this Section 2.4(f).

 

51







 

(iii)          Exoneration.  Without limiting the foregoing, no action or omission whatsoever by either Agent, any Revolving Lender, or the Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any of the Letters of Credit or any related matters shall result in any liability of either Agent, any Revolving Lender, or the Letter of Credit Issuer to any Borrower, or relieve any Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder to any such Person.

 

(iv)          Rights Against the Letter of Credit Issuer.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.4(f) is intended to limit any Borrower’s rights, if any, with respect to the Letter of Credit Issuer that arise as a result of the letter of credit application and related documents executed by and between such Borrower and the Letter of Credit Issuer.

 

(v)           Account Party.  Each Borrower hereby authorizes and directs the Letter of Credit Issuer to name any Borrower as the “Account Party” in any Letter of Credit and to deliver to the Agents all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to each such Letter of Credit, and to accept and rely upon either Agent’s instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with each such Letter of Credit or the application therefor.

 

(g)           Supporting Letter of Credit; Cash Collateral.  If, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(b) and Section 12.1, any Letter of Credit is outstanding on the Revolving Termination Date, then on the Revolving Termination Date the Borrowers shall deposit with the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Agents, the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Revolving Lenders, with respect to each such Letter of Credit then outstanding, either (i) a standby letter of credit (a “Supporting Letter of Credit”) in form and substance satisfactory to each Agent, issued by an issuer satisfactory to the Agents in their sole discretion in an amount equal to 105% of the maximum undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit, plus any fees and expenses associated with such Letter of Credit, under which Supporting Letter of Credit the Collateral Agent is entitled to draw amounts necessary to reimburse the Agents, the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Revolving Lenders for payments to be made by either of the Agents, the Letter of Credit Issuer, and any of the Revolving Lenders under or with respect to such Letter of Credit and any fees and expenses associated with such Letter of Credit or (ii) cash (a “Supporting Cash Deposit”) in an amount equal to 105% of the maximum undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit, plus any fees and expenses associated with such Letter of Credit.  Such Supporting Letter of Credit or Supporting Cash Deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Agents, the Letter of Credit Issuer, and the Revolving Lenders, as security for, and to provide for the payment of, the aggregate undrawn amount of such Letters of Credit remaining outstanding and the fees and expenses associated with such Letters of Credit.

 

Section 2.5            Bank Products.  Any Obligated Party may obtain Bank Products from BofA or Wachovia or any of BofA’s or Wachovia’s Affiliates, or, subject to the definition of Bank Products, another Revolving Lender or any of such Revolving Lender’s Affiliates, although no Obligated Party is required to do so.  To the extent Bank Products are provided by

 

52







 

an Affiliate of BofA, Wachovia or another Revolving Lender, the Obligated Parties agree to indemnify and hold the Agents and BofA, Wachovia or such other Revolving Lender, as applicable, harmless from any and all costs and obligations now or hereafter incurred by any of the Credit Providers which arise from any indemnity given by BofA, Wachovia or such other Revolving Lender, as applicable, to its Affiliates related to such Bank Products; provided, however, nothing contained herein is intended to limit any Obligated Party’s rights, with respect to BofA, Wachovia or such other Revolving Lender, as applicable, or its Affiliates, if any, that arise as a result of the execution of documents by and between such Obligated Party and BofA, Wachovia or such other Revolving Lender, as applicable, or its Affiliates that relate to Bank Products.  The agreement contained in this Section 2.5 shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Each Obligated Party acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of Bank Products from BofA, Wachovia , any other Revolving Lender or any of their respective Affiliates (a) is in the sole and absolute discretion of BofA, Wachovia, such other Revolving Lender or such Affiliate, and (b) is subject to all rules and regulations of BofA, Wachovia, such other Revolving Lender or such Affiliate.

INTEREST AND FEES

 

Section 3.1            Interest.

 

(a)           Interest Rates.  All outstanding Obligations (other than Term Loans and other Term Loan Obligations) shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by law, on accrued interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made or incurred until paid in full in cash at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate, as applicable, plus the Applicable Margin as set forth below, but not to exceed the Maximum Rate.  All Term Loans and other Term Loan Obligations shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by law, on accrued interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made or incurred until paid in full in cash at the interest rate set forth in clause (iii) below.  If at any time Revolving Loans are outstanding with respect to which a Borrower has not delivered to the Administrative Agent a notice specifying the basis for determining the interest rate applicable thereto in accordance herewith, such Revolving Loans shall be Base Rate Revolving Loans and bear interest at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate until notice to the contrary has been given to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement and such notice has become effective.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the outstanding Obligations shall bear interest as follows:

 

(i)            for all Base Rate Revolving Loans and other Obligations (other than LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, Term Loans and other Term Loan Obligations) at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to the lesser of (A) the Base Rate, plus the Applicable Margin or (B) the Maximum Rate;

 

53







 

(ii)           for all LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (A) the LIBOR Rate, plus the Applicable Margin or (B) the Maximum Rate; and

 

(iii)          for all Term Loans and other Term Loan Obligations at a per annum rate equal to the lesser of (A) 16% or (B) the Maximum Rate.

 

Each change in the Base Rate shall be reflected in the interest rate described in clause (i) preceding as of the effective date of such change.  Subject to Section 3.3, all interest charges on the Obligations shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).

 

(b)           Interest Payments.  The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the applicable Lenders, accrued interest in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, as applicable.

 

(c)           Default Rate.  During the existence of any Default or Event of Default if either of the Agents or the Majority Revolving Lenders (in the case of Revolving Obligations) or the Majority Term Lenders (in the case of Term Loan Obligations) in their discretion so elect (in the case of the Majority Revolving Lenders or the Majority Term Lenders, upon written notice to the Agents), the applicable Obligations shall, subject to Section 3.3, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the Default Rate applicable thereto or (ii) the Maximum Rate.

 

(d)           Interest Periods.  After giving effect to any Borrowing of any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, there may not be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods in effect hereunder.

 

Section 3.2            Continuation and Conversion Elections.

 

(a)           A Borrower may upon irrevocable written notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 3.2(b):

 

(i)            provided that Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans is permitted pursuant to Section 2.2, elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Revolving Loans to convert any such Base Rate Revolving Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), or that is in an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in excess thereof) into LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans;

 

(ii)           provided that Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans is permitted pursuant to Section 2.2, elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part thereof) in an amount not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), or that is in an integral multiple of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in excess thereof as LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans; or

 

54



 





 

(iii)          elect, as of any Business Day subject to Section 5.4, in the case of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans to convert any such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans (or any part thereof not being continued pursuant to clause (ii) preceding) into Base Rate Revolving Loans;

 

provided that if at any time the aggregate amount of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans in respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Revolving Loans; provided, further, that if the notice shall fail to specify the duration of the Interest Period of any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan to result from any such continuation or conversion, such Interest Period shall be one month in duration.

 

(b)           For any continuation or conversion pursuant to clause (a) preceding, the Borrowers shall deliver a notice of continuation/conversion in the form of Exhibit E or such other form as may be acceptable to the Agents, in their sole discretion (any such notice being referred to herein as a “Notice of Continuation/ Conversion”) to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York time) at least three Business Days in advance of the Continuation/Conversion Date specifying:

 

(i)             the proposed Continuation/Conversion Date;

 

(ii)           the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans to be continued or converted and, if continuing LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, the specific Revolving Loans (or portions thereof) to be continued or converted;

 

(iii)          the type of Revolving Loans resulting from the proposed continuation or conversion; and

 

(iv)          the duration of any requested Interest Period, provided, however, the Borrowers may not select an Interest Period that ends after the Stated Revolving Termination Date.

 

(c)           If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, the Borrowers have failed to timely select a new Interest Period to be applicable to such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans into Base Rate Revolving Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

 

(d)           On or before the deadline set forth in clause (b) preceding, in lieu of delivering a Notice of Continuation/Conversion, the Borrowers may give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice of any request for a continuation or conversion.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on such telephonic notice in continuing or converting such Revolving Loans, regardless of whether any written confirmation is received.

 

(e)           The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Continuation/Conversion.  All continuations and conversions

 

55







 

shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Loans held by each Revolving Lender with respect to which such notice was given.

 

(f)            After giving effect to any continuation or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, there may not be more than ten (10) different Interest Periods in effect hereunder.

 

(g)           At the election of either of the Agents or the Majority Revolving Lenders, the Borrowers shall have no right to convert any Base Rate Revolving Loans into LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans or to continue any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans as LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans during the existence of any Default or Event of Default.

 

Section 3.3             Maximum Interest Rate.  In no event shall the Interest Rate provided for in this Agreement applicable to any Obligation exceed the Maximum Rate.  If the Interest Rate applicable to any Obligation, absent the limitation set forth in this Section 3.3, would otherwise exceed the Maximum Rate, then such Interest Rate shall be the Maximum Rate, and, if in the future, such Interest Rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, then such Interest Rate shall remain at the Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid hereunder in respect of such Obligation equals the amount of interest which would have been paid in respect of such Obligation if the Interest Rate for such Obligation had not been limited to the Maximum Rate.  In the event that, upon payment in full of the applicable Obligation, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement in respect of such Obligation is less than the total amount of interest which would, but for this Section 3.3, have been charged, paid, or accrued in respect of such Obligation if the Interest Rate for such Obligation otherwise set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then the Borrowers shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have been charged, paid, or accrued in respect of such Obligation if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest which would have been charged, paid, or accrued in respect of such Obligation had the Interest Rate for such Obligation otherwise set forth in this Agreement, at all times, been in effect over (b) the amount of interest actually charged, paid, or accrued under this Agreement in respect of such Obligation.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either Agent and/or any Lender has charged, received, or demanded interest and other charges hereunder in respect of any Obligation in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess shall be deemed charged, received, or demanded on account of, and shall automatically be applied to reduce, the applicable Obligation other than interest, in the inverse order of maturity, and if there is no applicable Obligation outstanding, the applicable Agent and/or such Lender shall refund to the Borrowers (as applicable) such excess.

 

Section 3.4             Unused Line Fee.  Subject to Section 3.3, until the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, on the first day of each calendar month and on the Revolving Termination Date, an unused line fee (the “Unused Line Fee”) computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Unused Line Fee Percentage, multiplied by the amount by which (A) the average daily Maximum Revolver Amount exceeded

 

56







 

(B) the sum of the average daily outstanding amount of the Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and the average daily undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit during the immediately preceding calendar month or shorter period if calculated on the Revolving Termination Date.  Subject to Section 3.3, the Unused Line Fee shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed.  For purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee pursuant to this Section 3.4, any payment received by the Administrative Agent (if received prior to 12:00 noon (New York time)) shall be deemed to be credited to the Borrowers’ Loan Account on the Business Day such payment is received by the Administrative Agent.

 

Section 3.5             Letter of Credit Fees and Expenses.

 

(a)           Subject to Section 3.3, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares a fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) equal to the Letter of Credit Fee Percentage, multiplied by the average undrawn amount of each Letter of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder.  The Letter of Credit Fee shall be (i) computed on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual number of days elapsed and (ii) payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month following any month in which a Letter of Credit was issued and/or in which a Letter of Credit remained outstanding and on the Revolving Termination Date.

 

(b)           Subject to Section 3.3, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer, for its sole benefit, (i) all out-of-pocket costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the application for, processing, issuance, renewal, extension, or amendment of any Letter of Credit and (ii) a “fronting fee” in an amount equal to 0.125% of the face amount of such Letter of Credit on the date of issuance, renewal, or extension of each Letter of Credit.

 

Section 3.6             Other Fees.  Subject to Section 3.3, the Borrowers agree to pay the Agents when due all other fees and expenses as set forth in the Fee Letters.

 

Section 3.7             Term Closing Fee.  Subject to Section 3.3, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender on the Closing Date a closing fee in an amount equal to 1.632% of the New Term Loan Funding Amount of such Term Lender (the “Term Closing Fee”).

 

Section 3.8             Engagement Letter Fee.  Subject to Section 3.3, the Borrowers agree to pay to Banc of America Securities LLC on the Closing Date the arrangement fee described in the Fee Letter (as defined in the Engagement Letter).

Section 4.1             Repayment.

 

(a)           Revolving Loans.  The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans, together with all other non-contingent Obligations (other

 

57







 

than Term Loan Obligations), including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the Revolving Termination Date (or with respect to any Bank Products, any applicable earlier date).  The Borrowers may prepay the Revolving Loans, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, reborrow prior to the Revolving Termination Date.  In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrowers shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Lenders, the amount, if any and without duplication, by which the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings exceed the Borrowing Base.  The Borrowers shall have the option, without the consent of the Term Lenders, to request that the Revolving Lenders extend the Stated Revolving Termination Date to a date no later than the Stated Term Loan Termination Date, subject to the approval of all of the Revolving Lenders in their sole discretion.  In the event that the Borrowers wish to obtain a revolving credit facility on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of the Majority Term Lenders, are no less adverse taken as a whole to the Term Lenders than those contained in this Agreement with revolving credit lenders that are commercial banks, commercial finance companies or other asset-based lenders that provide asset-based revolving credit loans in the ordinary course of business, the Term Lenders agree to amend this Agreement or enter into a new loan agreement to provide for such replacement revolving credit facility on such terms; provided that in no event shall the foregoing obligate the Term Lenders to consent to any amendment to this Agreement or enter into a new loan agreement in respect of such replacement revolving credit facility which in the reasonable judgment of the Majority Term Lenders would be adverse to the Term Lenders taken as a whole; provided further that the Borrowers shall pay all of the Term Lenders’ reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred in connection with the negotiation of such replacement revolving credit facility.

 

(b)           Term Loans.  The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans, together with all other non-contingent Obligations, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee, if any, on the Term Loan Termination Date.

 

(c)           Payments.  All payments to be made by the Borrowers with respect to the Loans shall be made without setoff, recoupment, or counterclaim.  Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, to the account designated by the Administrative Agent and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date specified herein.  Any payment received by the Administrative Agent after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

 

(d)           LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan Payment Dates.  Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of Interest Period, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be.

 

58







 

Section 4.2             Termination of Credit Facility; Prepayment or Termination of Term Loans.  The Borrowers may, at any time, terminate this Agreement upon at least ten Business Days’ prior written notice thereof to the Agents, upon (a) the payment in full of all outstanding Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and the cancellation and return of all outstanding Letters of Credit (or alternatively with respect to each such Letter of Credit, the furnishing to the Collateral Agent of either a Supporting Cash Deposit or a Supporting Letter of Credit as required by Section 2.4(g)), (b) the payment of the Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee provided below (if applicable), and (c) the payment in full of all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations (including any amount due under Section 5.4) together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that this Agreement may not be terminated as to the Term Loans prior to the first Anniversary Date.  The Maximum Revolver Amount shall not be reduced except in connection with termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and payment in full of all Revolving Obligations as provided by this Section 4.2 or as otherwise provided in Section 4.3(f) or Section 11.2.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Maximum Revolver Amount shall be reduced to zero and the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be terminated upon the termination, in accordance with this Section 4.2, of the revolving credit facility provided hereunder (whether or not the Term Loans or any other Term Loan Obligations have been paid as provided in this Section 4.2).  Subject to Section 3.3, if this Agreement is terminated or all or any portion of the Term Loans are prepaid or repaid at any time prior to the date that is thirty months after the Closing Date, whether pursuant to Section 4.3 or pursuant to Section 11.2 or otherwise, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Term Lenders, a fee (the “Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee”) in an amount determined in accordance with the following table and allocated to each Term Lender pro rata based upon the amount of its Term Loans being so repaid, prepaid or terminated:

 

Period during which repayment, prepayment or early termination occurs

 

Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee

 

 

 

On or prior to the second Anniversary Date

 

3.00% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans being repaid, prepaid or terminated

2.00% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans being repaid, prepaid or terminated

 

No Term Loans may be voluntarily prepaid prior to the Revolving Facility Payment In Full.

 

Section 4.3             Mandatory Prepayment of the Loans.  Without limiting Section 4.1, each of the Borrowers agrees to make a prepayment with respect to the outstanding Loans and other Obligations as follows:

 

(a)           On any Business Day, if the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings exceed the Borrowing Base, the Borrowers shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Lenders, the amount (if any) of such excess for application to the principal amount of the Revolving Loans and, if after such application there

 

59







 

remains any portion of such excess, such remaining unapplied amount shall be delivered to and held by the Collateral Agent as cash collateral for the Obligations (contingent or otherwise) with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit.

 

(b)           All cash proceeds received by any Borrower from the Disposition or sale of Inventory or collection of Accounts in the ordinary course of business shall be applied to repayment of the applicable Obligations promptly (and in any event within one Business Day of receipt) as specified in Section 4.6(c).

 

(c)           The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, promptly (and in any event within one Business Day of receipt) all net cash proceeds received by an Obligated Party in connection with any Disposition, excluding proceeds received pursuant to clause (b) preceding, for application to the applicable Obligations as provided in Section 4.6(c).  As used in this Section 4.3(c), “net cash proceeds” means the proceeds of any applicable Disposition, minus (i) commissions and other reasonable and customary transaction costs, fees, and expenses properly attributable to such transaction and payable by such Obligated Party in connection therewith (in each case, paid to non-Affiliates), (ii) transfer taxes and (iii) amounts payable to holders of Liens (to the extent such Liens constitute Permitted Liens hereunder and such Liens are senior to the Agent’s Liens), if any, on the property subject to such Disposition to the extent the documentation governing such senior Liens required such payment to such holders upon such Disposition.

 

(d)           All cash payments or other cash proceeds received by any Obligated Party constituting proceeds of a Distribution, loan, or other advance (other than a Distribution, loan or advance by an Obligated Party to an Obligated Party) to such Obligated Party, excluding proceeds of Revolving Loans, Term Loans, the Second Lien Debt or the Refinancing Second Lien Debt, such proceeds which are proceeds of a loan or advance from one Borrower to another Obligated Party, and other than such proceeds which are proceeds of a loan or advance permitted under clause (c) through clause (j) of Section 8.12, shall be paid to the Administrative Agent promptly upon such receipt, for application to the applicable Obligations as specified in Section 4.6(c).

 

(e)           Upon any issuance of any Capital Stock of any Obligated Party, no later than two Business Days after such issuance, the Borrowers shall make a prepayment in an amount equal to the proceeds of such issuance, net of underwriting discounts, commissions, and other reasonable and customary transaction costs, fees, and expenses properly attributable to such transaction and payable by such Obligated Party in connection therewith (in each case paid to Persons who are not Affiliates of any Obligated Party) for application to the applicable Obligations in accordance with Section 4.6(c).

 

(f)            In any event, if any Obligated Party receives (i) net cash proceeds in connection with any Disposition, (ii) cash payments or other cash proceeds of a Distribution, loan, or other advance to such Obligated Party or (iii) proceeds of any issuance of Capital Stock, on or after the Closing Date, any such proceeds or payments shall be applied to the payment of the Revolving Loans (and after the payment in full of

the Revolving Loans and so long as no Event of Default is then continuing, to the payment of the Term Loans) to the extent necessary to avoid any requirement under any Second Lien Debt Documents or Refinancing Second Lien Debt Documents to prepay or redeem (or to make any offer to prepay or redeem) any portion of the Second Lien Debt or Refinancing Second Lien Debt, together with a permanent reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount in the amount of any such application to the Revolving Loans (such reduction to result in each Revolving Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment being permanently reduced by its Pro Rata Share of such reduction).  Any payment of the Term Loans made pursuant to this Section 4.3(f) and prior to the date that is thirty months after the Closing Date shall be accompanied by the Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee in accordance with Section 4.2.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Early Term Loan Prepayment Fee shall be payable in connection with any prepayments or payments on the Term Loans made at any time after thirty months after the Closing Date.

 

No provision contained in this Section 4.3 shall constitute a consent to an asset disposition, Distribution, loan, advance or equity issuance that is otherwise not permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.4             LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan Prepayments.  In connection with any prepayment, if any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans are prepaid prior to the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders, the amounts described in Section 5.4, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to pay the amounts described in Section 5.4 in connection with any Revolving Lender’s entering into an Assignment and Acceptance.

 

Section 4.5             Payments as Revolving Loans.  At the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations in connection with Letters of Credit, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including all reimbursement for expenses pursuant to Section 15.7), other sums payable under the Loan Documents, and any and all amounts equal to the excess of checks and other items presented to BofA for payment against the Funding Account or any other Deposit Account maintained by a Borrower with BofA in an amount greater than the then available balance in such Deposit Account may be paid with the proceeds of Revolving Loans made hereunder whether made following a request for such purpose by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.2 or pursuant to a deemed request as provided in this Section 4.5.  The Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to charge the Loan Account for the purpose of paying all amounts from time to time due under the Loan Documents (including as described in this Section 4.5) and agree that all such amounts charged shall constitute Revolving Loans (including Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) and that all such Revolving Loans shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Section 2.2; provided that, except as set forth in the succeeding sentence, so long as no Event of Default exists, the Administrative Agent shall not charge the Loan Account for expenses until 10 days have elapsed since the Administrative Agent has sent an invoice therefor to Ahern.  In the event the Collateral Agent is required to make any payment to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“WFB”) pursuant to the payoff letter delivered by WFB to Ahern and the Collateral Agent on the Original Closing Date with respect to that certain Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of July 25, 2003, the Administrative Agent shall immediately charge the Loan Account for the purpose of

 

61







 

reimbursing the Collateral Agent for all such payments and all such amounts charged shall constitute Revolving Loans.

 

Section 4.6             Apportionment, Application, and Reversal of Payments.

 

(a)           Principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the applicable Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments relate held by each applicable Lender) and payments of the fees shall, as applicable, be apportioned ratably among the applicable Lenders, except for fees payable solely to BofA, Wachovia, the Agents, either of them, Banc of America Securities LLC and the Letter of Credit Issuer and except as provided in Article 13.

 

(b)           Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, all payments shall be remitted to the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, to the Collateral Agent, and all such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of any Obligated Party’s Accounts or any other Collateral received by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, FIRST, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to either of the Agents from any Obligated Party, SECOND, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements then due to any of the Credit Providers other than the Agents from any Obligated Party, THIRD, to pay interest then due in respect of the Loans, including Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances, FOURTH, to pay or prepay principal of the Non-Ratable Loans and the Agent Advances, FIFTH, to pay or prepay principal of the Revolving Loans (other than the Non-Ratable Loans and the Agent Advances) and unpaid reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, SIXTH, during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, to pay an amount to the Collateral Agent equal to 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate amount of any unpaid reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and SEVENTH, to the payment of any other Obligation including any amounts relating to Bank Products due to BofA, Wachovia, any other Lender or any of their respective Affiliates by any of the Obligated Parties.  Subject to items “first” through “seventh” preceding, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Obligations.

 

(c)           Payments received pursuant to Section 4.3(b), Section 4.3(c), Section 4.3(d) and Section 4.3(e) shall be applied, ratably, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.3(f) and Section 4.6(e)), in the order of priority set forth for items “first” through “fifth” of clause (b) preceding at any time other than during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, and during the existence of any Default or Event of Default, as specified in clause (b) preceding but with such payments to be applied first, to payment or cash collateralization, as applicable, of the Revolving Obligations in accordance with the allocation arrangements prescribed in such clause (b) until fully paid or cash collateralized, as applicable, and thereafter to payment of the Term Loan Obligations.

 

62







 

(d)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by a Borrower, or unless an Event of Default is in existence, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Revolving Lender shall apply any payment which it receives to any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, except (i) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan or (ii) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding Base Rate Revolving Loans and, in any such event, the Borrowers shall pay the LIBOR breakage losses in accordance with Section 5.4.

 

(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) subject to clause (iii) of this Section 4.6(e), on the Stated Term Loan Termination Date, the Administrative Agent shall apply Collateral and proceeds of Collateral remitted to it (other than Collateral and proceeds of Collateral described in the last sentence of Section 10.1) to pay the outstanding Term Loan Obligations, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall allocate amounts received by it to Term Loan Obligations in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section 4.3(f), and (iii) with respect to all Collateral and proceeds of Collateral received by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent from and after the acceleration of the Obligations under this Agreement or the commencement of any bankruptcy or similar proceeding by or against any Obligated Party, such Collateral and proceeds of Collateral shall be applied first, to pay or cash collateralize, as applicable, the Revolving Obligations in accordance with the allocation arrangements prescribed in Section 4.6(b) until fully paid or cash collateralized, as applicable, and thereafter to pay the Term Loan Obligations.

 

Section 4.7             Indemnity for Returned Payments.  If after receipt of any payment or of any proceeds of Collateral that is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, any Credit Provider is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by such Credit Provider and the Borrowers shall be liable to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the applicable Credit Providers, and each Borrower hereby indemnifies the applicable Credit Providers and holds the applicable Credit Providers harmless for the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered.  The provisions of this Section 4.7 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any release of Collateral or guarantors, cancellation or return of Loan Documents, or other contrary action that may have been taken by any Credit Provider in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Credit Providers’ rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable.  The provisions of this Section 4.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.8             Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ Books and Records; Monthly Statements.  The Administrative Agent shall record the principal amount of the Loans, the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit, and the aggregate amount of unpaid reimbursement obligations outstanding with respect to the Letters of Credit from time to time on

 

63







 

its books.  In addition, each Lender may note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender’s Loans in its books and records.  Failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such notation shall not affect the obligations of the Borrowers with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit.  The Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent’s and each Lender’s books and records showing the Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute presumptive proof thereof, irrespective of whether any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument.  The Administrative Agent will provide to the Borrowers and the Revolving Lenders (and, if requested in writing by any Term Lender, such Term Lender) a monthly statement of Loans, payments, and other transactions pursuant to this Agreement.  Such statement shall be deemed correct, accurate, and binding on the Borrowers and an account stated (except for reversals and reapplications of payments made as provided in Section 4.6 and corrections of errors discovered by either of the Agents), unless a Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent in writing to the contrary within 30 days after such statement is rendered.  In the event a timely written notice of objections is given by a Borrower, only the items to which exception is expressly made will be considered to be disputed by the Borrowers.  Each Term Lender agrees to provide the Administrative Agent with such information as to the Term Loans and other Term Loan Obligations owing to such Term Lender and as to such Term Lender (including, without limitation, wire transfer information) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in order for the Administrative Agent to properly and accurately perform its duties under this Section 4.8, Section 4.6 and the other relevant provisions of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 5

 

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

 

Section 5.1             Taxes.

 

(a)           Any and all payments by the Obligated Parties, or any of them, to either Agent or any Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes.  In addition, subject to Section 14.10(c), the Obligated Parties shall pay all Other Taxes.

 

(b)           The Obligated Parties agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 5.1) paid by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.  Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender makes written demand therefor.

 

64



 





 

(c)                                  If an Obligated Party shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender, then:

 

(i)                                     the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings (including, without limitation, deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.1) the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

 

(ii)                                  such Obligated Party shall make such deductions and withholdings;

 

(iii)                               such Obligated Party shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with any applicable Requirement of Law; and

 

(iv)                              such Obligated Party shall also pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, or each Lender at the time interest is paid, all additional amounts that the respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the after-tax yield such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes had not been imposed.

 

(d)                                 Within 30 days after the date of any payment by any Obligated Party of Taxes or Other Taxes, such Obligated Party shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or other evidence of payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

 

(e)                                  If the Obligated Parties are required to pay additional amounts to any Lender pursuant to Section 5.1(c), then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by the Obligated Parties that may thereafter accrue, if such change in the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

 

Section 5.2                                      Illegality.

 

(a)                                  If any Revolving Lender determines that, after the date of this Agreement, the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Revolving Lender or its applicable lending office to make LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, then, on notice thereof by such Revolving Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Revolving Lender to make LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans shall be suspended until such Revolving Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

 

65







 

(b)                                 If a Revolving Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, the Borrowers shall, upon receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Revolving Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay in full such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lender then outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and amounts required under Section 5.4, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Revolving Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Revolving Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans.  If the Borrowers are required to so prepay any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, then concurrently with such prepayment, the Borrowers shall borrow from the affected Revolving Lender, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Revolving Loan.  Each Revolving Lender agrees to designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the judgment of such Revolving Lender, otherwise be disadvantageous to such Revolving Lender.

 

Section 5.3                                      Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.

 

(a)                                  If any Revolving Lender determines that due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance by such Revolving Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) made after the date of this Agreement, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Revolving Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding, or maintaining any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans, then the Borrowers shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, within three Business Days of demand by such Revolving Lender (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Revolving Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Revolving Lender for such increased costs.

 

(b)                                 If any Revolving Lender shall have determined that (to the extent it occurs after the date of this Agreement) (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by such Revolving Lender or any corporation or other entity controlling such Revolving Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Revolving Lender or any corporation or other entity controlling such Revolving Lender and (taking into consideration such Revolving Lender’s or such corporation’s or other entity’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Revolving Lender’s desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitment, loans, credits, or obligations under this Agreement, then, within three Business Days of demand by such Revolving Lender (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Revolving Lender, from time to time as specified by such

 

66







 

Revolving Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Revolving Lender for such increase.

 

Section 5.4                                      Funding Losses.  The Borrowers shall reimburse each Revolving Lender and hold each Revolving Lender harmless from any loss or expense that such Revolving Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of:

 

(a)                                  the failure of the Borrowers to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan;

 

(b)                                 except as permitted by Section 5.5, the failure of the Borrowers to (i) borrow any requested LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, (ii) continue any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, or (iii) convert a Base Rate Revolving Loan to a LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan, in each case, after any Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing, a Notice of Continuation/Conversion, or any telephonic notice in lieu thereof with respect thereto; or

 

(c)                                  the prepayment or other payment (including after acceleration thereof) of any LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period;

 

including any such loss of anticipated profit and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by such Revolving Lender (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin) to maintain its LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.  The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees, including a processing fee (the processing fee is currently Three Hundred Fifty Dollars ($350) but is subject to change from time to time by the Administrative Agent without notice), charged by the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Lender in connection with the foregoing.

 

Section 5.5                                      Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Administrative Agent determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan or that the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Revolving Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Revolving Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Revolving Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Revolving Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice in writing.  Upon receipt of a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.5, the Borrowers may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion then submitted by any of them.  If the Borrowers do not revoke any such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion, the Revolving Lenders shall make, convert, or continue the Revolving Loans, as proposed by the Borrowers, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by a Borrower, but such Revolving Loans shall be made, converted, or continued as Base Rate Revolving Loans instead of LIBOR Rate Revolving Loans.

 

67







 

Section 5.6                                      Certificate of the Affected Lender.  If any Lender claims reimbursement or compensation under this Article 5, the affected Lender shall determine the amount thereof and shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the affected Lender, and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error.

 

Section 5.7                                      Survival.  The agreements and obligations of the Borrowers in this Article 5 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

 

ARTICLE 6

 

BOOKS AND RECORDS; FINANCIAL INFORMATION; NOTICES

 

Section 6.1                                      Books and Records.  The Obligated Parties shall maintain, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to maintain, at all times, correct and complete books, records, and accounts in which full, true, complete, correct, and timely entries are made of such Person’s transactions in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.  The Obligated Parties shall reflect, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to reflect, by means of appropriate entries, in such accounts and in all Financial Statements proper liabilities and reserves for all taxes and proper provision for depreciation and amortization of property and bad debts, all in accordance with GAAP.  The Obligated Parties shall maintain at all times books and records pertaining to the Collateral in such detail, form, and scope as the Agents shall reasonably require, including, but not limited to, timely records of (a) all payments received and all credits and extensions granted with respect to the Accounts, (b) the return, rejection, repossession, stoppage in transit, loss, damage, or destruction of any Inventory, and (c) all other dealings affecting the Collateral.

 

Section 6.2                                      Financial and Other Information.  The Obligated Parties shall promptly furnish to the Agents all such information regarding the Obligated Parties’ and each of their Subsidiaries’ financial and business affairs as either of the Agents or any Lender (through either of the Agents, and the applicable Agent agrees to pass along all such reasonable requests by any Lender to the Obligated Parties) may reasonably request.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Obligated Parties will furnish, or cause to be furnished, to both Agents (with sufficient copies to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender) the following, in such detail as either of the Agents or the Lenders (through either of the Agents, and the applicable Agent agrees to pass along all such reasonable requests by any Lender to the Obligated Parties) shall reasonably request:

68







 

not later than 90 days after the close of each Fiscal Year of Ahern.  Such Financial Statements shall be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by and accompanied by a report thereon containing an opinion that is unqualified in any respect of, independent certified public accountants selected by Ahern (it being agreed by the parties hereto, however, that at any time after the Closing Date, the Agents shall have the right, in their reasonable discretion, to require that Ahern and its Subsidiaries retain independent certified public accountants of national standing to perform such examinations and provide such reports).  The Obligated Parties hereby authorize each of the Agents to communicate directly with the Obligated Parties’ certified public accountants and, by this provision, authorizes such accountants to disclose to each of the Agents any and all financial statements and other supporting financial documents and schedules relating to the Obligated Parties and to discuss directly with each of the Agents the finances and affairs of the Obligated Parties, provided that the applicable Agent shall provide the Obligated Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such discussions.

 

(b)                                 The Obligated Parties will furnish or cause to be furnished,

 

(i)                                     as soon as available, but in any event not later than 45 days after the end of each Fiscal Quarter, other than a Fiscal Quarter that is a year end, an unaudited balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flow for Ahern and its Subsidiaries prepared on a consolidated basis for the period from the beginning of the current Fiscal Year to the end of such Fiscal Quarter, all in reasonable detail and fairly presenting the financial position and results of operations of Ahern and its Subsidiaries as at the date thereof and for such period, and, in each case, in comparable form, figures for the corresponding period in the prior Fiscal Year, and in the Latest Projections, and prepared in accordance with GAAP (other than the omission of footnotes and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments, if any) applied consistently with the audited Financial Statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a); and

 

(ii)                                  as soon as available, but in any event not later than 30 days after the end of each Fiscal Month, an unaudited balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flow for Ahern and its Subsidiaries prepared on a consolidated basis for the period from the beginning of the current Fiscal Year to the end of such Fiscal Month, all in reasonable detail and fairly presenting the financial position and results of operations of Ahern and its Subsidiaries as at the date thereof and for such period, and, in each case, in comparable form, figures for the corresponding period in the prior Fiscal Year, and in the Latest Projections, and prepared in accordance with GAAP (other than the omission of footnotes and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments, if any, and, solely in the case of the financial statements for the Fiscal Months of January and February of each Fiscal Year, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments from the prior Fiscal Year that have an impact on the financial statements for such Fiscal Months) applied consistently with the audited Financial Statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a).

 

69







 

Ahern shall certify by a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer that all such Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (other than the omission of footnotes and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments, if any) applied consistently with the audited Financial Statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a) and present fairly, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments, the financial position of Ahern and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and their results of operations for the periods then ended.

 

(c)                                  The Obligated Parties will cause to be furnished, with each of the Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a), a letter from the independent certified public accountants that audited such Financial Statements to the effect that such accountants are familiar with this Agreement and that, in auditing such Financial Statements, they did not become aware of any fact or condition which then constituted a Default or Event of Default with respect to a financial covenant set forth in Section 8.21, except for those, if any, described in reasonable detail in such letter.

 

(d)                                 The Obligated Parties will furnish or cause to be furnished, with each of the Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a), and with each of the Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b)(i), a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Ahern in the form of Exhibit C (a “Compliance Certificate”), or another form acceptable to the Agents in their discretion, (i) setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to establish compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 8.21 during the period covered by such Financial Statements and as at the end thereof and (ii) except as explained in reasonable detail in such certificate, (A) stating that all of the representations and warranties of the Obligated Parties contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are correct and complete in all material respects as at the date of such certificate as if made at such time, except for those that speak as of a particular date, (B) stating that the Obligated Parties are, at the date of such certificate, in compliance in all material respects with all of their respective covenants and agreements in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (C) stating that no Default or Event of Default then exists or existed during the period covered by such Financial Statements, (D) analyzing in reasonable detail the material variances of the figures in the Latest Projections and corresponding Financial Statements for the prior Fiscal Year and (E) certifying, to the Obligated Parties’ knowledge, that the amount of the Unused Availability during the period covered by such certificate did not fall to an amount which would give rise to an Accelerated Delivery Date or, if the Unused Availability fell to any such amount, the first date on which such event occurred.  If such certificate discloses that a representation or warranty is not correct or complete, or that a covenant has not been complied with, or that a Default or Event of Default existed or exists, such certificate shall set forth what action the Obligated Parties have taken or propose to take with respect thereto.  In addition, if, as a result of any change in accounting principles and policies from those used in the preparation of the audited Financial Statements referred to in Section 7.6(a), the consolidated Financial Statements of Ahern and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or (b) will differ in any material respect from the consolidated Financial Statements that would have been delivered pursuant to such clauses had no such change in accounting principles and policies been made, then the Obligated Parties will deliver to both Agents (with sufficient

The Obligated Parties acknowledge that one or more of the Term Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e. Term Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to any Obligated Party or its securities).  Ahern agrees to make any and all material and/or information to be provided by any of the Obligated Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document intended to be distributed or made available to the Lenders (collectively, “Obligated Parties Material”) clearly and conspicuously designated by Ahern as “PUBLIC” if such Obligated Parties Material is either publicly available or not material information (though it may be sensitive and proprietary) with respect to the Obligated Parties and their respective securities for purposes of the United States Federal and state securities laws.  Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary, unless and until a Term Lender notifies the Administrative Agent in writing to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall only furnish or make available to such Term Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document Obligated Parties Material clearly and conspicuously designated by Ahern as “PUBLIC”.

ARTICLE 7

 

GENERAL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

 

Each Obligated Party warrants and represents to the Agents and the other Credit Providers as follows:

 

Section 7.1                                    Authorization, Validity, and Enforceability of the Transaction Documents.  Each Obligated Party has the power and authority to execute, deliver, and perform this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to incur the indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations it has agreed to undertake under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and to grant the Agent’s Liens.  Each Obligated Party has taken all necessary action (including obtaining approval of the owners of its Capital Stock or any other Person required to provide approval or consent, if necessary) to authorize its execution, delivery, and performance of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.  The Transaction Documents to which each Obligated Party is a party have been duly executed and delivered by such Obligated Party, and constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of such Obligated Party, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms without defense, setoff, or counterclaim except as such enforceability is limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and to the effect of general principles of equity whether applied by a court of law or equity.  Each Obligated Party’s execution, delivery, and performance of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not and will not conflict with, or constitute a violation or breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property of any Obligated Party by reason of the terms of (a) any contract, mortgage, Lien, lease, agreement, indenture, document, or instrument to which such Obligated Party is a party or that is binding upon it, (b) any Requirement of Law applicable to such Obligated Party, or (c) the Organization Certificate or Management Agreement of such Obligated Party.  Each Borrowing and each delivery by any or all of the Borrowers (or Ahern on behalf of the Borrowers) of a Borrowing Base Certificate constitutes a representation and warranty by Ahern that, as of the date of such Borrowing or delivery, as the case maybe (both before and after giving effect to such Borrowing, if applicable), the financial accommodations provided to the Borrowers hereunder do not violate the debt incurrence limits set forth in the Second Lien Debt Agreement or exceed the Maximum First Lien Principal Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).  Without limitation of the foregoing, the Borrowers represent and warrant that (i) each Borrowing is permitted under Section 4.09(b)(1) of the Second Lien Debt Agreement, (ii) each Borrowing is permitted to be incurred and secured by all applicable Secured Debt Documents (as defined in the Second Lien Debt Agreement) and constitutes Priority Lien Debt (as defined in the Second Lien Debt Agreement), (iii) all Obligations constitute “First Lien Obligations” as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) there are in existence no Credit Facilities (as defined in the Second

 

79







 

Lien Debt Agreement) other than this Agreement and (v) there is in existence no Parity Lien Debt (as defined in the Second Lien Debt Agreement) other than Second Lien Debt.  There is no restriction or other impediment (legal, contractual or otherwise) to the cancellation of Second Lien Debt as contemplated in Section 2.3(a) and, upon the making of the Term Loans on the Closing Date, Second Lien Debt shall be cancelled in the aggregate principal amount required under Section 2.3(a).

 

Section 7.2                                    Validity and Priority of Security Interest.  The provisions of the Loan Documents create legal and valid Liens on the Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, and such Liens (a) constitute perfected and continuing Liens on the Collateral, securing the Obligations, (b) are enforceable against the applicable Obligated Party and all third parties, and (c) have priority over all other Liens on the Collateral except for those Liens identified in clause (b) through clause (h) or clause (k) through clause (l) of the definition of Permitted Liens (but only to the extent any such Permitted Liens would have priority over the Agent’s Liens pursuant to any Requirement of Law) and Liens perfected only by possession (including possession of any certificate of title) to the extent the Collateral Agent has not obtained or does not maintain possession of such Collateral.

 

Section 7.3                                    Organization, Authority, and Good Standing.  Each of the Obligated Parties

 

(a)                                  is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, or other business entity duly and properly formed, incorporated, or organized and validly existing under Requirements of Law of the jurisdiction of its formation, incorporation, or organization as set forth in Schedule 7.3, and such jurisdiction is the only jurisdiction under which it is formed, incorporated, or organized,

 

(b)                                 has all requisite power and authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which it conducts business and to own its property, and

 

(c)                                  to the extent applicable, is qualified and in good standing under the Requirements of Law of (i) its jurisdiction of formation, incorporation, or organization and (ii) each other jurisdiction in which qualification is necessary in order for it to own or lease its property and conduct its business.

 

Section 7.4                                    Capitalization and Subsidiaries.  As of the Closing Date, Schedule 7.4 sets forth (a) a correct and complete list of the relationship of the Obligated Parties and all of their respective Subsidiaries, (b) the location of the chief executive office of each of the Obligated Parties, (c) a true and complete listing of each class of the Capital Stock of each of the Obligated Parties, of which all of such issued shares or other interests are validly issued, outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable, and owned beneficially and of record by the Persons identified in Schedule 7.4, (d) the type of entity of each of the Obligated Parties, (e) the jurisdiction of formation, incorporation or organization of each of the Obligated Parties and the employer or taxpayer identification number of each of the Obligated Parties and the organizational identification number issued by each of the Obligated Parties’ jurisdiction of formation, incorporation, or organization (or a statement that no such number has been issued).  Each Obligated Party has only one state of formation, incorporation, or organization.

 

80







 

Section 7.5                                    Corporate Name; Prior Transactions.  As of the Closing Date, Schedule 7.5 sets forth a correct and complete list of the name of each Obligated Party as it appears in official filings in the jurisdiction of its formation, organization, or incorporation.  Except as set forth in Schedule 7.5, no Obligated Party has, during the past five years, been known by or used any other corporate or fictitious name, or been a party to any merger or consolidation, or acquired all or substantially all of the assets of any Person, or acquired any of its property outside of the ordinary course of business.

 

Section 7.6                                    Financial Statements and Projections.

 

(a)                                  The Obligated Parties have delivered to each Agent and the Lenders the audited financial statements for Ahern and its Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008, accompanied by the report thereon of Ahern’s independent certified public accountants, Piercy Bowler Taylor & Kern.  The Obligated Parties have also delivered to each Agent and the Lenders the unaudited balance sheet and related statements of income and cash flow for Ahern and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the end of the Fiscal Month ending November 30, 2009.  All such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present the financial position of Ahern and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and their results of operations for the periods then ended (except with respect to the unaudited financial statements referred to immediately above, for the omission of applicable footnotes and subject to normal year-end audit adjustments).  Except as set forth on Schedule 7.6, as of the Closing Date, Ahern and its Subsidiaries do not have any material liabilities that are not disclosed in such financial statements.

Section 10.5                               Accounts.

 

(a)                                  Representations.  Each Obligated Party hereby represents and warrants, with respect to its Accounts, that:  (i) each existing Account represents, and each future Account will represent, a bona fide sale or lease and delivery of goods by such Obligated Party, or rendition of services by such Obligated Party, in the ordinary course of such Obligated Party’s business; (ii) each existing Account is, and each future Account will be, for a liquidated amount payable by the Account Debtor thereon on the terms set forth in the invoice therefor or in the schedule thereof delivered to the Agents, without any offset, deduction, defense, or counterclaim except those known to such Obligated Party and disclosed to the Agents pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) no payment will be received with respect to any Account, and no credit, discount, or extension, or any agreement therefor, will be granted on any Account, except as reported to the Agents in Borrowing Base Certificates delivered in accordance with this Agreement; (iv) each copy of an invoice delivered to either of the Agents by such Obligated Party will be a genuine copy of the original invoice sent to the Account Debtor named therein; and (v) all goods described in any invoice representing a sale or lease of goods will have been delivered to the Account Debtor and all services of such Obligated Party described in each invoice will have been performed.

 

(b)                                 Dating Terms.  No Obligated Party will re-date any invoice or sale or lease or make sales or leases on extended dating beyond that customary in such Obligated Party’s business or extend or modify any Account except in the ordinary course of business.  If any Obligated Party becomes aware of any matter materially adversely affecting the collectibility of any Account or the Account Debtor therefor, including information regarding the Account Debtor’s creditworthiness, such Obligated Party will exclude such Account from Eligible Accounts and, with respect to any such Account Debtor that is obligated on Accounts owing to any Obligated Party, in an aggregate amount greater than $250,000, promptly so advise the Agents.

 

(c)                                  Notes and Instruments.  Without the prior written consent of the Agents, (i) during the existence of any Default or Event of Default, no Obligated Party will accept any note or other instrument (except a check or other instrument for the immediate payment of money) with respect to any Account and (ii) at any time other than as provided in clause (i) preceding no Obligated Party will accept notes or other instruments in any Fiscal Year in excess of $100,000 for all Accounts or accept notes or other instruments in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate at any time outstanding during the term of this Agreement.  Any such instrument accepted by any Obligated Party with respect to any Account shall be considered as evidence of the Account and not payment thereof and such Obligated Party will promptly deliver such instrument to the Collateral Agent, endorsed by such Obligated Party to the Collateral Agent in a manner satisfactory in form and substance to the Agents.  Regardless of the form of presentment, demand, or notice of protest with respect thereto, delivery of any such note or other instrument to the Collateral Agent does not constitute payment of the Obligations.

 

(d)                                 Disputes and Claims.  Each Obligated Party shall notify the Agents promptly of all disputes and claims in excess of $250,000 with any Account Debtor, and

 

112







 

agrees to settle, contest, or adjust such dispute or claim at no expense to either of the Agents or any other Credit Provider.  No discount, credit, or allowance shall be granted to any such Account Debtor without the Agents’ prior written consent, except for discounts, credits, and allowances made or given in the ordinary course of the applicable Obligated Party’s business when no Event of Default exists.  Upon either of the Agent’s request, each Obligated Party shall send the Agents a copy of credit memoranda. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Obligated Party that is a Borrower shall promptly report that credit on Borrowing Base Certificates submitted by the Obligated Parties.  Each of the Agents may at all times when an Event of Default exists, settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms that such Agent shall consider advisable and, in all cases, the applicable Agent will credit the Loan Account with the net amounts received by such Agent in payment of any Accounts.

 

(e)                                  Returned Inventory.  If an Account Debtor returns any Inventory to any Obligated Party for any reason when no Event of Default exists (other than Inventory leased by an Obligated Party in the ordinary course of its business that is returned to such Obligated Party by the applicable lessee), then such Obligated Party shall promptly determine the reason for such return and shall issue a credit memorandum to the Account Debtor in the appropriate amount.  Each Obligated Party shall promptly report to the Agents any such return involving an amount in excess of $250,000.  Each such report shall indicate the reasons for the return and the location and condition of the returned Inventory.  In the event any Account Debtor returns Inventory to any Obligated Party for any reason when an Event of Default exists (other than Inventory leased by an Obligated Party in the ordinary course of its business that is returned to such Obligated Party by the applicable lessee), such Obligated Party, upon the request of either of the Agents, shall:  (i) hold the returned Inventory in trust for the Agents; (ii) segregate all such returned Inventory from all of such Obligated Party’s other property; (iii) dispose of the returned Inventory solely according to the Agents’ written instructions; and (iv) to the extent lawfully permitted, not issue any credits or allowances with respect thereto without the Agents’ prior written consent.  All returned Inventory shall be subject to the Agent’s Liens thereon.  Whenever any Inventory is returned (other than Inventory leased by an Obligated Party in the ordinary course of its business that is returned to such Obligated Party by the applicable lessee), the related Account shall be deemed ineligible to the extent of the amount owing by the Account Debtor with respect to such returned Inventory and such returned Inventory shall not be Eligible Inventory, in each instance, except to the extent such returned Inventory is Inventory (other than spare parts Inventory) held for lease in the ordinary course of an Obligated Party’s business that is marked with an identifiable serial number or is Inventory held for sale that was returned for reasons other than the quality of the Inventory and is still readily marketable to other Persons.

 

(f)                                    Leases.  Each lease of Inventory by an Obligated Party to one of its customers is entered into in the ordinary course of business of such Obligated Party and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligated Party and, to the best of each Obligated Party’s knowledge, the customer party thereto.  No such lease (i) contravenes any laws, rules or regulations applicable thereto (including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, laws, rules and regulations relating to consumer

 

113







 

protection, fair credit billing, fair credit reporting, truth in lending, equal credit opportunity, fair debt collection practices and privacy) and the Obligated Party that is party thereto is not in violation of any such law, rule or regulation with respect thereto, (ii) requires the customer party thereto to consent to the transfer, assignment or pledge of any of the rights of such Obligated Party under such lease or (iii) contains or is otherwise subject to a confidentiality provision that purports to restrict the ability of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent to exercise its rights under this Agreement with respect to such lease, including, without limitation, its rights to review such lease or to enforce such lease.  No Obligated Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Agents, (i) amend, modify or supplement in any material respect its forms of leases of Inventory from that in effect on the Original Closing Date except for those amendments, modifications or supplements made in order to comply with changes in applicable law or (ii) enter into a lease of Inventory which is materially different from one of its forms of lease in existence on the Original Closing Date (as such form may be amended, modified or supplemented in compliance with clause (i) above).

 

Section 10.6                               Collection of Accounts; Payments.

 

(a)                                  [Intentionally Omitted].

 

(b)                                 Collections.  Each Obligated Party shall collect its Accounts and other Collateral in the ordinary course of its business consistent with past practice.  Each Obligated Party shall promptly (in any event within one Business Day of receipt thereof) deposit all such payments (except as permitted in clause (c) below) and receipts, and all other proceeds of Collateral received by it, in their original form, duly endorsed in blank (if applicable) into a Clearing Account or deliver such payments and receipts to the Collateral Agent in their original form, duly endorsed in blank (if applicable), as either of the Agents may direct.  Each Obligated Party shall receive any and all proceeds of Accounts and other Collateral as the Collateral Agent’s trustee.  All collections received directly by any Obligated Party or either Agent, and all funds in any Clearing Account or other account to which such collections are deposited shall be subject to the Collateral Agent’s sole control and withdrawals by any Obligated Party shall not be permitted.

 

(c)                                  Accounts.  Each Clearing Account of any Obligated Party shall be established with BofA or a Clearing Bank reasonably acceptable to the Agents and, except as set forth in the next sentence, subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement.  No Obligated Party shall maintain any Clearing Account or Deposit Account except with BofA or subject to a Deposit Account Control Agreement, except those Clearing Accounts and Deposit Accounts existing on the Closing Date and listed on Schedule 7.23 that are not maintained with BofA; provided that with respect to any such account, the Obligated Parties shall deliver a Deposit Account Control Agreement with respect to any such account within 45 days of a request therefor by the Administrative Agent.  No Obligated Party shall maintain any lockbox except with BofA or Wachovia.

 

(d)                                 Cash Sales or Rentals.  If sales or rentals of Inventory are made or services are rendered for cash, the applicable Obligated Party shall, within one Business Day of receipt, deliver to the Collateral Agent or deposit into a Clearing Account the cash that

 

114







 

such Obligated Party receives; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to cash in an amount not to exceed $10,000 in the aggregate for all Obligated Parties at any time.

 

(e)                                  Payments.  All payments received by either of the Agents at a bank account designated by any of them will be the Collateral Agent’s sole property for the benefit of the Credit Providers and will be credited to the Loan Account (conditional upon final collection) after allowing one (1) Business Day for collection, including immediately available funds, as required by Section 4.3; provided that, except during the existence of an Event of Default, such payments shall be deemed to be credited to the Loan Account immediately upon receipt for purposes of (i) determining the Unused Availability, (ii) calculating the Unused Line Fee, and (iii) calculating the amount of interest accrued thereon solely for purposes of determining the amount of interest to be distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders (but not the amount of interest payable by the Borrowers).  During the existence of any Event of Default, either of the Agents may, in its sole discretion, require that only payments representing final collections be credited to the Loan Account for the purposes set forth in clause (i), clause (ii), and clause (iii) preceding.

 

Section 10.7                               Inventory; Perpetual Inventory.  Each Obligated Party represents and warrants and agrees that all of the Inventory owned by such Obligated Party that is included in Eligible Inventory is and will be held for sale or lease, or is to be furnished in connection with the rendition of services or held as spare parts Inventory, in each case, in the ordinary course of such Obligated Party’s business, and is and will be fit for such purposes.  Each Obligated Party will keep its Inventory in good and marketable condition, except for damaged, obsolete or defective goods arising in the ordinary course of such Obligated Party’s business.  No Obligated Party will, without the prior written consent of the Agents, acquire or accept any Inventory on consignment or approval, except that Ahern may accept inventory on consignment from Kubota Tractor Corporation and other vendors, so long as (i) the aggregate amount of such consigned inventory held by all of the Obligated Parties does not exceed $2,000,000 at any one time and (ii) none of such consigned inventory is rented by any Obligated Party to any of its customers.  Each Obligated Party agrees that all Inventory produced by such Obligated Party in the U.S. will be produced in accordance with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and all rules, regulations, and orders thereunder.  Each Obligated Party will conduct cycle counts of its Inventory such that all of its Inventory shall be counted (though at varying times) at least once per Fiscal Year and, during the existence of an Event of Default, at such other times as either of the Agents requests.  Each Obligated Party will maintain a perpetual inventory reporting system at all times.  Each Obligated Party, at its own expense, shall make available to the Agents upon request the results of each physical verification, if any, which such Obligated Party may in its discretion have made, or caused any other Person to have made on its behalf, of all or any portion of its Inventory.  No Obligated Party will, without the Agents’ written consent, sell any Inventory on a bill-and-hold, guaranteed sale, sale and return, sale on approval, consignment, or other repurchase or return basis.  No Obligated Party will permit any of its Inventory to become a fixture with respect to Real Estate or (except for spare parts Inventory other than Eligible Spare Parts Inventory) to become an accession with respect to other personal property with respect to which Real Estate or personal property the Collateral Agent does not have a Lien.  No Obligated Party will, without the Agents’ prior written consent, alter or remove any identifying symbol or number on any of such Obligated Party’s Inventory constituting Collateral.

 

115







 

Section 10.8                                Equipment.

 

(a)                                  Changes to Equipment.  Each Obligated Party shall promptly inform the Agents of any material additions to or deletions from such Obligated Party’s Equipment and shall indicate if any such material additions include any Equipment that is subject to any certificate of title law of the U.S. or any state.  No Obligated Party will permit any of its Equipment to become a fixture with respect to Real Estate or to become an accession with respect to other personal property with respect to which Real Estate or personal property the Collateral Agent does not have a Lien.  No Obligated Party will, without the Agents’ prior written consent, alter or remove any identifying symbol or number on any of such Obligated Party’s Equipment constituting Collateral.  Except as set forth in Section 8.9, no Obligated Party shall, without the Majority Revolving Lenders’ (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders’) prior written consent, sell, license, lease as a lessor, or otherwise dispose of any of such Obligated Party’s Equipment.

 

(b)                                 Certificates of Title.  Each Obligated Party shall (i) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, in the case of Equipment now owned in which a security interest is perfected by a notation on the certificate of title or similar evidence of the ownership of such goods and (ii) within 30 days of acquiring any other similar Equipment, in each case, cause the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, to be named as lienholder on any such certificate of title or other evidence of ownership and deliver to the Collateral Agent any and all certificates of title of such Equipment reflecting such lien.

 

Section 10.9                                Assigned Contracts.  Each Obligated Party shall fully perform all of its obligations under each of the Assigned Contracts, and shall enforce all of its rights and remedies thereunder, in each case, as it deems appropriate in its business judgment; provided that no Obligated Party shall take any action or fail to take any action with respect to its Assigned Contracts that would cause the termination of a material Assigned Contract.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Obligated Party shall take all action necessary or appropriate to permit, and shall not take any action that would have any materially adverse effect upon, the full enforcement of all indemnification rights under its Assigned Contracts.  Each Obligated Party shall notify the Agents in writing, promptly after such Obligated Party becomes aware thereof, of any event or fact that could give rise to a material claim by it for indemnification under any of its Assigned Contracts, and shall diligently pursue such right and report to the Agents on all further developments with respect thereto.  Each Obligated Party shall deposit into a Clearing Account or remit directly to the Administrative Agent, for application to the Obligations in such order as the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) shall determine (unless such order is otherwise expressly provided herein, in which case in the order so provided), all amounts received by such Obligated Party as indemnification or otherwise pursuant to its Assigned Contracts.  If any Obligated Party shall fail after either of the Agent’s demand to pursue diligently any right under such Obligated Party’s Assigned Contracts, or if an Event of Default then exists, either of the Agents may, and at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) shall, directly enforce such right in the name of such Agent or in such Obligated Party’s name and may enter into such settlements or

 

116







 

other agreements with respect thereto as either of the Agents or the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders), as applicable, shall determine.  In any suit, proceeding, or action brought by either of the Agents under any Assigned Contract for any sum owing thereunder or to enforce any provision thereof, each Obligated Party shall indemnify and hold the Agents and the other Credit Providers harmless from and against all expense, loss, or damage suffered by reason of any defense, setoff, counterclaims, recoupment, or reduction of liability whatsoever of the obligor thereunder arising out of a breach by any Obligated Party of any obligation thereunder or arising out of any other agreement, indebtedness, or liability at any time owing from any Obligated Party to or in favor of such obligor or its successors.  All such obligations of any Obligated Party shall be and remain enforceable only against such Obligated Party and shall not be enforceable against the Agents or any of the other Credit Providers.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, each Obligated Party shall at all times remain liable to observe and perform all of its duties and obligations under its Assigned Contracts, and the Collateral Agent’s, the Administrative Agent’s or any Credit Provider’s exercise of any of their respective rights with respect to the Collateral shall not release any Obligated Party from any of such duties and obligations.  None of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Provider shall be obligated to perform or fulfill any Obligated Party’s duties or obligations under its Assigned Contracts or to make any payment thereunder, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment or property received by it thereunder or the sufficiency of performance by any party thereunder, or to present or file any claim, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance, any payment of any amounts, or any delivery of any property.

 

Section 10.10                          Documents, Instruments, and Chattel Paper.  Each Obligated Party represents and warrants that (a) all Documents, Instruments, and Chattel Paper describing, evidencing, or constituting Collateral, and all signatures and endorsements thereon, are and will be complete, valid, and genuine, and (b) all goods evidenced by Documents, Instruments, Letter-of-Credit Rights, and Chattel Paper are and will be owned by the applicable Obligated Party, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.  If any Obligated Party retains possession of any Chattel Paper or Instruments, such Chattel Paper and Instruments shall (i) if acquired by an Obligated Party prior to the Closing Date, be marked with the legend required by Section 10.10 of the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement and (ii) if acquired by an Obligated Party on or after the Closing Date, be marked with the following legend:  “This writing and the obligations evidenced or secured hereby are subject to the security interest of Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Agents and the other Credit Providers pursuant to that certain Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of January 8, 2010, among Ahern Rentals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates, the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, and the lending institutions party thereto.”  No Obligated Party will, without the prior written consent of the Agents, modify, amend or alter in any respect the terms and conditions of any material Instrument included in the Collateral, nor forgive any indebtedness evidenced by any such Instrument.

 

Section 10.11                          Right to Cure.  Either of the Agents may, in its discretion, and the Agents shall, at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders), pay any amount or do any act required of any Obligated Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document in order to preserve, protect, maintain, or enforce the Obligations, the Collateral, or the Agent’s Liens, and that any Obligated

 

117







 

Party fails to pay or do, including payment of any judgment against any Obligated Party, any insurance premium, any warehouse charge, any finishing or processing charge, any landlord’s, bailee’s or consignee’s claim, and any other Lien upon or with respect to the Collateral.  All payments that either of the Agents make under this Section 10.11 and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses that either of the Agents pay or incur in connection with any action taken by it hereunder shall be payable by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 15.7 and, prior to the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, shall be charged to the Borrowers’ Loan Account as a Revolving Loan.  Any payment made or other action taken by either of the Agents under this Section 10.11 shall be without prejudice to any right to assert an Event of Default hereunder and to proceed thereafter as herein provided.

 

Section 10.12                          Power of Attorney.  Each Obligated Party hereby appoints the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent’s and the Collateral Agent’s designees as such Obligated Party’s attorney, with power:  (a) to endorse or sign such Obligated Party’s name on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, or other forms of payment or security that come into the Collateral Agent’s, the Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s possession; (b) to sign such Obligated Party’s name on any invoice, bill of lading, warehouse receipt, or other negotiable or non-negotiable Document constituting Collateral, on drafts against customers, on assignments of Accounts, on notices of assignment, financing statements and other public records and to file any such financing statements by electronic means with or without a signature as authorized or required by applicable law or filing procedure; (c) during the existence of any Event of Default, to notify the post office authorities to give the Collateral Agent access to any post office or mailboxes into which mail addressed to such Obligated Party is delivered and to receive, open, and dispose of all mail addressed to such Obligated Party; (d) to send requests for verification of Accounts to customers or Account Debtors; (e) during the existence of any Event of Default, to complete in such Obligated Party’s name, the Administrative Agent’s name or the Collateral Agent’s name, any order, sale, lease or transaction, obtain the necessary Documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof; (f) to clear Inventory through customs in such Obligated Party’s name, the Administrative Agent’s name, the Collateral Agent’s name, or the name of the Administrative Agent’s designee or the Collateral Agent’s designee, and to sign and deliver to customs officials powers of attorney in such Obligated Party’s name for such purpose; (g) to the extent, if any, that such Obligated Party’s authorization given in Section 10.2(h) is not sufficient, and without otherwise limiting such authorization, to file such financing statements with respect to this Agreement, with or without such Obligated Party’s signature, as either of the Agents may deem appropriate and to execute in such Obligated Party’s name such financing statements and amendments thereto and continuation statements that may require such Obligated Party’s signature; (h) during the existence of any Event of Default, to endorse such Obligated Party’s name on all applications, documents, papers, and instruments necessary or reasonably desirable for either of the Agents in the use of such Obligated Party’s Proprietary Rights; (i) during the existence of any Event of Default, to grant or issue any exclusive or non-exclusive license under such Obligated Party’s Proprietary Rights to any Person; (j) during the existence of an Event of Default, to assign, convey, or otherwise transfer title in or Dispose of any of such Obligated Party’s Proprietary rights to any Person; and (k) to do all other things reasonably necessary to carry out the terms of this Agreement.  Each Obligated Party ratifies and approves all acts of such attorney.  None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider will be liable for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact

 

118







 

or law except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct.  This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until this Agreement has been terminated and the Obligations have been fully and irrevocably satisfied.

 

Section 10.13                          The Collateral Agent’s, the Administrative Agent’s and the Lenders’ Rights, Duties, and Liabilities.

 

(a)                                  The Obligated Parties’ Liability for the Collateral.  Each Obligated Party assumes all responsibility and liability arising from or relating to the use, sale, lease, license, or other disposition of the Collateral.  The Obligations shall not be affected by any failure of either of the Agents or any other Credit Provider to take any steps to perfect the Agent’s Liens or to collect or realize upon any of the Collateral, nor shall loss of or damage to any of the Collateral release any Obligated Party from any of the Obligations.  During the existence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may (but shall not be required to), and at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) shall, without notice to or consent from any Obligated Party, sue upon or otherwise collect, extend the time for payment of, modify or amend the terms of, compromise or settle for cash, credit, or otherwise upon any terms, grant other indulgences, extensions, renewals, compositions, or releases, and take or omit to take any other action with respect to the Collateral, any security therefor, any agreement relating thereto, any insurance applicable thereto, or any Person liable directly or indirectly in connection with any of the foregoing, without discharging or otherwise affecting the liability of any Obligated Party for the Obligations or under this Agreement or any other agreement now or hereafter existing between the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and/or any other Credit Provider and such Obligated Party.

 

(b)                                 The Obligated Parties’ Liability Under Contracts and Licenses.  It is expressly agreed by each Obligated Party that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, such Obligated Party shall remain liable under each of its contracts and each of its licenses to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder.  None of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Provider shall have any obligation or liability under any contract or license by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the granting herein of a Lien thereon or the receipt by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Provider of any payment relating to any contract or license pursuant hereto.  None of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or any other Credit Provider shall be required or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of any Obligated Party under or pursuant to any contract or license, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any contract or license, or to present or file any claims, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts that may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

 

(c)                                  Notification of Account Debtors.  Without limiting Section 11.2, at any time during the existence of an Event of Default (or if any rights of setoff (other than

 

119







 

setoffs against an Account arising under the contract giving rise to the same Account) or contra accounts may be asserted with respect to the following), the Collateral Agent may, without prior notice to any Obligated Party, and upon the request of either of the Agents each Obligated Party shall, notify Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on the Collateral that the Collateral Agent has a security interest therein, and that payments shall be made directly to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Credit Providers.  Once any such notice has been given to any Account Debtor or other Person obligated on the Collateral, no Obligated Party shall give any contrary instructions to such Account Debtor or other Person without the Agents’ prior written consent.

 

(d)                                 Information Regarding Accounts and Account Debtors.  The Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent may at any time in the name of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, or in the name of any Obligated Party, or in the name of the Collateral Agent’s or the Administrative Agent’s nominee or designee, communicate with each Obligated Party’s Account Debtors, parties to contracts, and obligors in respect of Instruments to verify with such Persons, to the Collateral Agent’s or the Administrative Agent’s, as applicable, satisfaction, the existence, amount, and terms of Accounts, payment intangibles, Instruments, or Chattel Paper.  If an Event of Default exists, each Obligated Party, at its own expense, shall cause the independent certified public accountants then engaged by such Obligated Party to prepare and deliver to each of the Agents (with sufficient copies to the Administrative Agent for distribution to each Lender) at any time and from time to time promptly upon either of the Agent’s request the following reports with respect to such Obligated Party:  (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts; (ii) an aging of all Accounts; (iii) trial balances; and (iv) a test verification of such Accounts as such Agent may request.

 

(e)                                  No Obligation of the Agents.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Obligated Party agrees that neither of the Agents shall have any obligation to take any steps necessary to preserve rights in any of the Proprietary Rights of any Obligated Party against any other Person, provided that each of the Agents may do so at its option during the existence of any Event of Default in accordance with Section 10.14(f).

 

Section 10.14                          Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Collateral.

 

(a)                                  Representations.  This Agreement is effective to create a valid and continuing Lien on and, upon filing of appropriate financing statements pursuant to the UCC, perfected Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent, on the Proprietary Rights of each Obligated Party and such perfected Liens are enforceable as against any and all creditors of such Obligated Party.  Upon filing of all such appropriate financing statements pursuant to the UCC, all action necessary to protect and perfect the Collateral Agent’s Lien on each Obligated Party’s Proprietary Rights under Requirements of Law shall have been duly taken.  Upon filing the Proprietary Rights Security Agreements with the United States Copyright Office or Unites States Patent and Trademark Office, as applicable, the Agent’s Liens will be enforceable against any purchaser of the Proprietary Rights covered thereby.

 

120







 

(b)                                 Notices to the Agents.  Each Obligated Party shall notify the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent promptly upon such Obligated Party obtaining knowledge that any application or registration relating to any patent, trademark, or copyright (now or hereafter existing) may become abandoned or dedicated, or of any adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, or any court) regarding such Obligated Party’s ownership of any patent, trademark, or copyright, its right to register the same, or to keep and maintain the same.

 

(c)                                  Additional Agreements.  In no event shall any Obligated Party, either directly or through any agent, employee, licensee, or designee, file an application for the registration of any patent, trademark, or copyright with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office, or any similar Governmental Authority, or enter into any new license as licensor with respect to any patent, trademark, or copyright, without giving the Agents prior written notice thereof, and, upon request of either of the Agents, such Obligated Party shall execute and deliver such Proprietary Rights Security Agreements or other documents as either of the Agents may request to evidence the Agent’s Liens on such patent, trademark, or copyright, and the General Intangibles of such Obligated Party relating thereto or represented thereby.

 

(d)                                 Further Actions.  Each Obligated Party shall take all actions necessary or requested by either of the Agents to maintain and pursue each application, to obtain the relevant registration and to maintain the registration of each of such Obligated Party’s material Proprietary Rights (now or hereafter existing), including the filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of noncontestability and opposition and interference and cancellation proceedings.

 

(e)                                  Notices of Infringement.  In the event that any of the Proprietary Rights that are Collateral are infringed upon, or misappropriated or diluted by a third party, each Obligated Party shall notify the Agents promptly after such Obligated Party learns thereof.  Each Obligated Party shall, unless it shall reasonably determine that such Proprietary Rights that are Collateral are in no way material to the conduct of its business or operations, promptly sue for infringement, misappropriation, or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation, or dilution, and shall take such other actions as either of the Agents shall deem appropriate under the circumstances to protect such Proprietary Rights that are Collateral.

 

(f)                                    Suits by the Agents.  Without limiting Section 11.2, during the existence of any Event of Default, each of the Agents shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to bring suit in the name of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to enforce the Proprietary Rights and, if either of the Agents shall commence any such suit, each Obligated Party shall, at the request of such Agent, do any and all lawful acts and execute any and all proper documents reasonably required by such Agent in aid of such enforcement.  Each Obligated Party shall, upon demand, promptly reimburse each of the Agents for all costs and expenses incurred by such Person in the

Section 11.2                                Remedies.

 

(a)                                  During the existence of any Default or Event of Default, either of the Agents may, in its discretion, and the Agents shall, at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders, do one or more of the following at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligated Party:  (i) reduce the Maximum Revolver Amount, or the advance rates against the Net Amount of Eligible Accounts, Eligible Transportation Equipment and/or Eligible Inventory used in computing the Borrowing Base and/or any other advance rates or amounts used in computing the Borrowing Base (including increasing the amount of any Reserve); (ii) restrict the amount of or refuse to make Revolving Loans; and (iii) instruct the Letter of Credit Issuer to restrict or refuse to provide Letters of Credit.

 

(b)                                 During the existence of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall, at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders, but only with respect to clauses (iii) and (v) below), do one or more of the following:  (i) take any of the actions described in clause (a) preceding, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or demand on any Obligated Party; (ii) terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments, the obligation of the Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans under this Agreement, and the obligation of the Agents to cause the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder; (iii) declare all of the Obligations to be immediately due and payable (except for Obligations under Hedge Agreements or with respect to other Bank Products, which remedy shall be governed by the terms and conditions contained in such Hedge Agreements or the respective documents governing other Bank Products); provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 11.1(e), Section 11.1(f), Section 11.1(g), or Section 11.1(h), the Revolving Credit Commitments shall automatically and immediately expire and all Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind; (iv) require the Obligated Parties to provide cash collateral in an amount equal to 105% of all Obligations (contingent or otherwise) outstanding with respect to Letters of Credit; and (v) pursue its other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and any Requirement of Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing for 180 or more consecutive days, the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Majority Term Lenders, shall declare all of the Obligations to be immediately due and payable (except for Obligations under Hedge Agreements or with respect to other Bank Products, which remedy shall be governed by the terms and conditions contained in such Hedge Agreements or in the respective documents governing other Bank Products) and commence (if not already commenced) and pursue its other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and any applicable law in a commercially reasonable manner (it being understood and agreed that no Term Lender shall have the right to direct the manner or order of the exercise of rights or remedies and each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may exercise its rights and remedies all in such order and in such manner as it shall determine in its sole discretion).

 

127







 

(c)                                  During the existence of any Event of Default:  (i) the Collateral Agent shall have, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, in addition to all other rights of the Credit Providers, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Loan Documents and the UCC; (ii) the Collateral Agent may, at any time, take possession of the Collateral and keep it on any Obligated Party’s premises, at no cost to the Credit Providers, or remove any part of the Collateral to such other place or places as the Collateral Agent may desire, or any Obligated Party shall, upon the Collateral Agent’s demand, at such Obligated Party’s cost, assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place reasonably convenient to the Collateral Agent; (iii) the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent’s designee may notify the Obligated Parties’ Account Debtors that the Obligated Parties’ Accounts have been assigned to the Collateral Agent and of the Agent’s Lien therein, and may collect such Accounts directly and charge the collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account as a Revolving Loan:  and (iv) the Collateral Agent may sell and deliver any Collateral at public or private sales, for cash, upon credit, or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Collateral Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion, and may, if the Collateral Agent deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the Collateral by an announcement at the time and place of sale or of such postponed or adjourned sale without giving a new notice of sale.  Without in any way requiring notice to be given in the following manner, each Obligated Party agrees that any notice by the Collateral Agent of sale, disposition, or other intended action hereunder or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to the Obligated Parties if such notice is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or is delivered personally against receipt, at least ten days prior to such action to the Obligated Parties’ address specified in or pursuant to Section 15.8.  If any Collateral is sold on terms other than payment in full at the time of sale, no credit shall be given against the Obligations until the Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or the Lenders receive payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Collateral Agent may resell the Collateral without further notice to any Obligated Party.  In the event the Collateral Agent seeks to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral by judicial process, each Obligated Party irrevocably waives the posting of any bond, surety, or security with respect thereto that might otherwise be required, any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action to recover the Collateral, and any requirement that the Collateral Agent retains possession and not dispose of any Collateral until after trial or final judgment.  Each Obligated Party agrees that the Collateral Agent has no obligation to preserve rights to the Collateral or marshal any Collateral for the benefit of any Person.  In addition to any license granted pursuant to Section 10.16, the Collateral Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without charge, each Obligated Party’s labels, patents, copyrights, name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar property, in completing production of, advertising, or selling any Collateral, and each Obligated Party’s rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the Collateral Agent’s benefit for such purpose.  The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of sale, including Attorney Costs, and then to the Obligations as provided in Section 4.6(b).  The Collateral Agent will return any excess to the Obligated Parties, except as required by the Intercreditor

 

128







 

Agreement or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise direct, and the Obligated Parties shall remain liable for any deficiency.

 

(d)                                 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Obligated Party expressly agrees that, during the existence of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement, or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Obligated Party or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements, and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the UCC and other applicable law), may forthwith enter upon the premises of any Obligated Party where any Collateral is located through self-help, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving such Obligated Party or any other Person notice and opportunity for a hearing on the Collateral Agent’s claim or action and may collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and may forthwith sell, lease, license, assign, give an option or options to purchase, or sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or contract to do so), or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at a public or private sale or sales, at any exchange at such prices as the Collateral Agent may deem acceptable, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk.  The Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and/or one or more of the other Credit Providers, the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, which equity of redemption each Obligated Party hereby releases.  Such sales may be adjourned and continued from time to time with or without notice.  The Collateral Agent shall have the right to conduct such sales on any Obligated Party’s premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use each Obligated Party’s premises without charge for such time or times as the Collateral Agent deems necessary or advisable.

 

(e)                                  Each Obligated Party further agrees, at the Collateral Agent’s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at a place or places designated by the Collateral Agent that are reasonably convenient to the Collateral Agent and such Obligated Party, whether at such Obligated Party’s premises or elsewhere.  Until the Collateral Agent is able to effect a sale, lease, or other disposition of the Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall have the right to hold or use the Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving the Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to any Obligated Party to maintain or preserve the rights of such Obligated Party as against third parties with respect to any Collateral while such Collateral is in the possession of the Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of the Collateral, or any part thereof, and to enforce any of the Collateral Agent’s remedies (for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and the other Credit Providers), with respect to such appointment without prior notice or hearing as to such appointment.  The Collateral Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization, or sale to the Obligations as provided in Section 4.6(b), and only after so paying over such net proceeds, and after the payment by the Collateral

 

129





 

Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law (and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or a decision, order or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), need the Collateral Agent account for the surplus, if any, to the applicable Obligated Party.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Obligated Party waives all claims, damages, and demands against the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider arising out of the repossession, retention, or sale of the Collateral except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Collateral Agent or such other Credit Provider as determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Each Obligated Party agrees that ten days prior notice by the Collateral Agent of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters.  Each Obligated Party shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations, including any attorneys’ fees or other expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent or any other Credit Provider to collect such deficiency.

 

(f)                                    Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the other Loan Documents, each Obligated Party hereby waives presentment, demand, protest, or any notice (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Agreement or any Collateral.

 

(g)                                 To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Collateral Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Obligated Party acknowledges and agrees that it is not commercially unreasonable for the Collateral Agent (i) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Collateral Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work-in-process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (ii) if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (iii) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (iv) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (v) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (vi) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as such Obligated Party, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (vii) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (viii) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (ix) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (x) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession, or quiet enjoyment, (xi) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Collateral Agent against risks of loss, collection, or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Collateral Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (xii) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants, and other professionals to

 

130







 

assist the Collateral Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral.  Each Obligated Party acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 11.2(g) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in the Collateral Agent’s exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Collateral Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 11.2(g).  Without limiting the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 11.2(g) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Obligated Party or to impose any duties on the Collateral Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by Requirement of Law in the absence of this Section 11.2(g).

 

(h)                                 Without limiting Section 10.12(c), during the existence of an Event of Default, each Obligated Party, at the Collateral Agent’s request, shall execute and deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents as the Collateral Agent shall require to grant the Collateral Agent access to any post office box in which collections of Accounts are received.

 

(i)                                     During the existence of an Event of Default, the Obligated Parties will, at the Collateral Agent’s request, with respect to all Inventory financed by Letters of Credit, instruct all suppliers, carriers, forwarders, customs brokers, warehouses, or others receiving or holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents, or instruments in which the Collateral Agent holds a security interest to deliver them to the Collateral Agent and/or subject to the Collateral Agent’s order, and if they shall come into any Obligated Party’s possession, to deliver them, upon request, to the Collateral Agent in their original form.  The Obligated Parties shall also, at the Collateral Agent’s request, during the existence of an Event of Default, designate the Collateral Agent as the consignee on all bills of lading and other negotiable and non-negotiable documents or cause all such documents to designate the applicable Obligated Party as the consignee subject to the Agent’s Liens.

 

(j)                                     During the existence of an Event of Default, each Obligated Party hereby waives all rights to notice and hearing prior to the exercise by the Collateral Agent of the Collateral Agent’s rights to repossess the Collateral without judicial process or to replevy, attach, or levy upon the Collateral without notice or hearing.

 

Section 11.3                                Term Lender Purchase Option.

 

(a)                                  The Administrative Agent agrees that it will provide the Term Lenders prompt written notice of the first time the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings shall become $90,000,000 or less (such notice, the “Revolver Outstandings Notice”).  Following delivery by the Administrative Agent to the Term Lenders of the Revolver Outstandings Notice, the Term Lenders shall have the option, exercisable no later than five Business Days after delivery of the Revolver Outstandings Notice, to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Revolving Obligations from the Credit Providers holding same (such Credit Providers, together with the Agents, the “Revolving Obligation Credit Providers”) and to assume all (but not less than all) of the commitments and other obligations of the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers under the Loan Documents (other than the obligations of the Administrative Agent under this Section 11.3 and obligations of the

Revolving Obligation Credit Providers under Hedge Agreements and other Bank Products) (such commitments and other obligations to be assumed, the “Assumed Obligations”).  The Term Lenders electing to purchase Revolving Obligations and assume Assumed Obligations pursuant to this Section 11.3 (the “Purchasing Parties”) shall exercise such option through delivery of written notice (a “Purchase Notice”) to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall irrevocably obligate the Purchasing Parties to purchase the Revolving Obligations and assume the Assumed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to each Revolving Lender a copy of each Purchase Notice received by it.  Each Purchasing Party shall participate in such purchase and assumption on a Purchasing Party Pro Rata Basis (as hereafter defined).  For purposes of this Section 11.3, “Purchasing Party Pro Rata Basis” means, with respect to a Purchasing Party, the percentage obtained by dividing the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held by such Purchasing Party by the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans held by all the Purchasing Parties.  The foregoing purchase and assumption option shall be irrevocable once exercised, including, without limitation, in the event that the Aggregate Revolver Outstandings shall exceed $90,000,000 on the Purchase Date (as defined below).  The Agents, the Revolving Lenders and the other Revolving Obligation Credit Providers shall have no obligation at any time prior to the consummation of the purchase and assumption to forgo providing any financial accommodations to any of the Borrowers or other Obligated Parties but after the purchase and assumption option has been timely exercised in accordance with the terms hereof and until the earliest of the consummation of the purchase and assumption, the Purchase Date or the revocation or termination of the purchase and assumption option, the Agents shall not commence any foreclosure or other action to sell or otherwise realize upon Collateral (it being agreed that the foregoing shall not prohibit either Agent from applying any Collateral or proceeds of Collateral received by it to the payment or cash collateralization of Revolving Obligations).  For the avoidance of doubt, (i) there shall be only one purchase and assumption option under this Section 11.3, (ii) only one Revolver Outstandings Notice will be delivered under this Section 11.3 and (iii) if the Purchasing Parties do not timely exercise the above purchase and assumption option or any of the Purchasing Parties does not timely comply with its obligations to purchase its share of all of the Revolving Obligations and assume its share of all of the Assumed Obligations (so that all Revolving Obligations are purchased and all Assumed Obligations are assumed on the Purchase Date in accordance with the terms hereof), the purchase and assumption option hereunder shall be irrevocably revoked and terminated.

 

(b)                                 On the date specified by the Administrative Agent (which date shall not be later than ten Business Days after the date of the Revolver Outstandings Notice and no earlier than six Business Days after the date of the Revolver Outstandings Notice) (the “Purchase Date”), the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers shall sell and assign to the Purchasing Parties, and the Purchasing Parties shall purchase and assume from the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers, all of the respective Revolving Obligations and Assumed Obligations of the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers.  The Purchasing Parties shall be irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to effect such purchase and assumption on the terms herein on the Purchase Date.  The Obligated Parties and the other parties hereto hereby agree that each Revolving Obligation Credit Provider shall have the right, at any time after any Purchase Notice is delivered by a Term Lender to the

 

132







 

Administrative Agent, to terminate any and all Hedge Agreements and other Bank Products extended or provided by it to any Obligated Party, all without any liability to such Revolving Obligation Credit Provider and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any such Hedge Agreement or any document governing any such other Bank Product.

 

(c)                                  The Purchasing Parties shall (i) on the Purchase Date (A) pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the relevant Revolving Obligation Credit Providers, as the purchase price therefor the full amount of all the Revolving Obligations then outstanding and unpaid (including in any event (1) all outstanding principal of the Revolving Obligations, (2) all accrued and unpaid interest (including interest accruing on or after the commencement of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding by or against any Obligated Party, whether or not a claim for such interest is, or would be, allowed in such proceeding), (3) all fees, breakage costs (to the extent actually incurred), matured indemnification obligations and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses owing under the Loan Documents, (4) all unreimbursed amounts drawn under any Letters of Credit, but excluding the undrawn amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit, and (5) all amounts owing to either of the Agents and any of the other Revolving Obligation Credit Providers with respect to any Hedge Agreements or other Bank Products extended or provided to any Obligated Party (including, in any event, all amounts owing with respect to any Hedge Agreements or other Bank Products extended or provided to any Obligated Party terminated on or prior to the Purchase Date)) and (B) furnish cash collateral to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the relevant Revolving Obligation Credit Providers, in an amount equal to the sum of (1) an amount equal to 105% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Purchase Date; provided that such amount shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the obligations arising in connection with a drawing under any such Letters of Credit and fees and expenses related thereto (and applied to satisfy such obligations as they become due) and (2) for each Hedge Agreement or other Bank Product extended or provided to any Obligated Party not terminated on or prior to the Purchase Date, an amount reasonably determined by the Revolving Obligation Credit Party party to or otherwise providing such Hedge Agreement or other Bank Product to be necessary to collateralize its credit risk arising out of such Hedge Agreement or other Bank Product, (ii) upon and after the Purchase Date, reimburse the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers within five Business Days of written demand for any loss, cost, damage or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses) related to any checks or other payments provisionally credited to the Revolving Obligations and/or as to which any of the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers have not yet received final payment, (iii) if the cash collateral under clause (i)(B)(2) above with respect to any Hedge Agreement or other Bank Product is less than the amount owing by the relevant Obligated Party under or with respect to such Hedge Agreement or other Bank Product, after the Purchase Date reimburse the applicable Revolving Obligation Credit Provider within five Business Days of written demand for any such deficiency, (iv) upon and after the Purchase Date, within five Business Days after the written request from the Administrative Agent, reimburse the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers in respect of matured indemnification obligations of each Obligated Party under any of the Loan Documents and (v) on the Purchase Date, assume all of the Assumed Obligations.  Each

 

133







 

of the Purchasing Parties shall fund its Purchasing Party Pro Rata Basis of any payment required to be made under this clause (c) and shall assume its Purchasing Party Pro Rata Basis of the Assumed Obligations.

 

(d)                                 Such purchase price and cash collateral shall be remitted on the Purchase Date by wire transfer in United States dollars and in immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent to such bank account of the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing to the Purchasing Parties for such purpose.  The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, distribute the amounts received by it in respect of such purchase price to the relevant Revolving Obligation Credit Providers, pro rata according to the respective Revolving Obligations owing to the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers sold pursuant to this Section 11.3.  Interest shall be calculated to (and including) the day on which such purchase and assumption shall occur if the amounts so paid by the Purchasing Parties to the bank account designated by the Administrative Agent are all received in such bank account prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, and interest shall be calculated to and including the next Business Day if any of the amounts so paid by the Purchasing Parties to the bank account designated by the Administrative Agent are received in such bank account later than 12:00 noon, New York time.

 

(e)                                  Such purchase and assumption shall be expressly made without representation or warranty of any kind by the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers as to the Revolving Obligations, the Assumed Obligations, the Collateral or otherwise and without recourse to the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers, except that each Revolving Obligation Credit Provider shall represent and warrant to the Purchasing Parties on the Purchase Date immediately before giving effect to the purchase and assumption that:  (i) such Revolving Obligation Credit Provider owns its portion of the Revolving Obligations to be sold by it under this Section 11.3 free and clear of any liens or encumbrances and (ii) such Revolving Obligation Credit Provider has the right to sell its portion of the Revolving Obligations to be sold by it under this Section 11.3 and its sale is duly authorized by all necessary action on its part.  The terms of such purchase and assumption shall be set forth in documentation prepared by counsel to the Administrative Agent (at the reasonable expense of the Purchasing Parties to be paid on the Purchase Date as part of the purchase price) which is mutually acceptable to each of the Administrative Agent, the other Revolving Obligation Credit Providers and the Purchasing Parties and consistent with the terms hereof.  The purchase and assumption documentation shall contain an unconditional waiver by the Purchasing Parties and the Obligated Parties of all claims against the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers arising out of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby and an unconditional release and discharge of the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers of all Assumed Obligations (including, without limitation, any commitment or agreement to provide or arrange any financial accommodations to any Obligated Party under this Agreement).  Each Revolving Obligation Credit Provider shall retain all rights to indemnification provided in the Loan Documents for all periods prior to the purchase of the Revolving Obligations pursuant to this Section 11.3.

 

134



 





 

(f)                                    Each of the parties hereto (x) agrees that the provisions of Section 13.2 shall not apply to the purchase and assumption contemplated by this Section 11.3 and (y) consents to such purchase and assumption.

 

(g)                                 The obligations of the Revolving Obligation Credit Providers to sell and assign their respective Revolving Obligations and Assumed Obligations under this Section 11.3 are several and not joint and several.  If a Revolving Obligation Credit Provider breaches its obligation to sell its Revolving Obligations or assign its Assumed Obligations under this Section 11.3 (a “Defaulting Revolving Obligation Credit Provider”), no other Revolving Obligation Credit Provider will be obligated to purchase or assume the Defaulting Revolving Obligation Credit Provider’s Revolving Obligations or Assumed Obligations for resale or assignment to the Purchasing Parties.  A Revolving Obligation Credit Provider that complies with this Section 11.3 will not be in default of this Section 11.3 or otherwise be deemed liable for any action or inaction of any Defaulting Revolving Obligation Credit Provider; provided that nothing in this clause (g) will require the Purchasing Parties to purchase less than all of the Revolving Obligations to be sold under this Section 11.3.

138







 

Agents by the assigning Lender and the Assignee, (ii) the assigning Lender and the Assignee shall have delivered to Ahern and the Agents an Assignment and Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit F (an “Assignment and Acceptance”), together with, in the case of delivery to the Administrative Agent, any Term Loan Note subject to such assignment, and (iii) the assigning Lender or the Assignee has paid to each of the Agents a processing fee in the amount of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500).  If applicable, the Borrowers agree to promptly execute and deliver new Term Loan Notes and replacement Term Loan Notes as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to evidence assignments of Term Loans in accordance herewith.

(e)                                  Any Lender (the “originating Lender”) may at any time sell to one or more Participants participating interests in any Loans, the Revolving Credit Commitment of the originating Lender, and the other interests of the originating Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that (i) the originating Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Obligated Parties and the Agents shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Lender in connection with the originating Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document except for the matters set forth in, in the case of a Lender that is a Revolving Lender, Section 13.1(b)(i), Section 13.1(b)(ii), and Section 13.1(b)(iii) and, in the case of a Lender that is a Term Lender, Section 13.3(b)(i), and (v) all amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if the originating Lender had not sold such participation, except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same limitation as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

 

(f)                                    Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Federal Reserve Board or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 C.F.R. §203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.

 

140







 

(g)                                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, any Term Lender, any Second Lien Lender or any affiliate of either of them (excluding in any event any such Person that is a Revolving Lender on the Closing Date) that after the Closing Date acquires, by assignment or otherwise, any Revolving Credit Commitment or any Revolving Loans (such Person, a “Dual Lender”) shall, for purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro Rata Shares, be deemed not to hold any Revolving Credit Commitments, any Revolving Loans or any other Revolving Obligations; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may agree in writing in its sole discretion that the provisions of this Section 13.2(g) shall not apply to a Dual Lender that (x) is not itself a Second Lien Lender at the time such Dual Lender first acquires any Revolving Credit Commitment or any Revolving Loans and (y) is an Eligible Assignee under clause (i) of such definition that is a commercial bank, commercial finance company or other asset-based lender that provides asset-based revolving credit loans in the ordinary course of its business (and not a hedge fund).

 

(h)                                 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 13.2, if an assigning Lender desires pursuant to this Section 13.2 to assign to a Second Lien Lender or any affiliate thereof (other than (x) any Person that is a Revolving Lender on the Closing Date or (y) Liberty Harbor Master Fund I, L.P. (“Liberty Harbor”)) (such Second Lien Lender or affiliate intended to be party to such assignment, the “Intended Assignee”) all or any portion of such assigning Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Revolving Loans, such assigning Lender will be required to provide written notice thereof (the “ROFR Notice”) to Liberty Harbor and each Agent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the intended date of such assignment and provide Liberty Harbor with a right of first refusal, as set forth in this Section 13.2(h), with respect to the assignment of such Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Loans intended to be assigned by such assigning Lender.  The ROFR Notice shall set forth all of the material terms of the proposed assignment to the Intended Assignee (including the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment to be assigned by the assigning Lender, the aggregate amount or percentage of the Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender to be assigned by the assigning Lender and any other economic terms relevant to such proposed assignment, including any discounts to be realized or fees to be paid) and shall be accompanied by an Assignment and Acceptance between such assigning Lender and Liberty Harbor for such assignment reflecting such terms to be executed by Liberty Harbor.  Upon receipt of a ROFR Notice and related Assignment and Acceptance, Liberty Harbor will have the right to purchase such Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Loans of the assigning Lender on the terms set forth in such ROFR Notice and such Assignment and Acceptance, which right may only be exercised with respect to all of the Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Loans being offered pursuant to such ROFR Notice and Assignment and Acceptance, exercisable by Liberty Harbor by: (i) delivering written notice thereof to the assigning Lender and the Agents (the “Election Notice”) within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such ROFR Notice; (ii) executing and delivering to the assigning Lender (with a copy to each Agent) the Assignment and Acceptance for such assignment provided by the assigning Lender with the ROFR Notice and delivering to the assigning Lender and the Agents all information, notices and other documents required under this Section 13.2 to assign such Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving

 

141





 

Loans (collectively with such Assignment and Acceptance, the “Assignment Materials”), within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Election Notice (or such later time as agreed to by the assigning Lender in its sole discretion as notified in writing to Liberty Harbor and each Agent); and (iii) consummating the assignment within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of the Election Notice (or such later time as agreed to by the assigning Lender in its sole discretion as notified in writing to Liberty Harbor and each Agent) (the “ROFR Closing Date”).  If Liberty Harbor fails to timely deliver an Election Notice and/or timely execute and/or deliver the Assignment Materials and/or timely consummate the assignment it shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its rights under this Section 13.2(h) with respect to such ROFR Notice.

 

If Liberty Harbor timely delivers an Election Notice and timely executes and/or delivers the Assignment Materials as required above, the closing of the assignment shall be on the ROFR Closing Date therefor.  As a condition to the effectiveness of the assignment on such ROFR Closing Date (i) Liberty Harbor shall pay or cause to be paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available funds all amounts required to be paid under the Assignment Materials or otherwise agreed between the assigning Lender and Liberty Harbor and (ii) either the assigning Lender or Liberty Harbor shall have paid to each Agent the processing fee payable to such Agent pursuant to Section 13.2(a).  If the conditions required under the preceding sentence are not satisfied on the ROFR Closing Date, then Liberty Harbor shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived its rights under this Section 13.2(h) with respect to such assignment.  Any such assignment shall be subject to the requirements of this Section 13.2 (including, without limitation, those in clause (a) thereof).  Each of the Agents and the Borrowers hereby consents to any assignment to Liberty Harbor contemplated by this clause (h), but subject to clause (g) above.

 

If Liberty Harbor waives (or is deemed to have waived) its right to acquire the Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Loans offered by the assigning Lender in a given ROFR Notice, the Revolving Credit Commitment and Revolving Loans offered by the assigning Lender may be sold by the assigning Lender to the Intended Assignee, on the same terms offered to Liberty Harbor in the ROFR Notice, at any time during the next thirty (30) Business Day period subsequent to the expiration of the three (3) Business Day period for Liberty Harbor to respond to the ROFR Notice.

 

In determining if an assigning Lender must comply with this Section 13.2(h) with respect to an assignment of all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Revolving Loans to an Assignee, such assigning Lender shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any representation and warranty made by such Assignee in the relevant Assignment and Acceptance or in a certificate of such Assignee as to whether or not such Assignee is a Second Lien Lender or any affiliate thereof.

 

Nothing contained herein shall limit the right of either Agent or the Borrowers under this Section 13.2 to object to any assignment to any Second Lien Lender or any of its affiliates of all or any portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Revolving Loans of a Revolving Lender.

(a)                                  Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and designates each of BofA, acting in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, and Wachovia, acting in its capacity as the Collateral Agent, as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent to take such action on such Lender’s behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Each of the Collateral

 

146







 

Agent and the Administrative Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Article 14.  Other than as expressly provided in Section 14.10 and Section 14.11, the provisions of this Article 14 are solely for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the other Credit Providers, and no Obligated Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall either of the Agents have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or Participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against either of the Agents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” in this Agreement or any other Loan Document with reference to the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.  Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.  Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent is expressly entitled to take or assert under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including (as applicable) (i) the determination of the applicability of ineligibility criteria with respect to the calculation of the Borrowing Base, (ii) the making of Agent Advances pursuant to Section 2.2(j), and (iii) the exercise of remedies pursuant to Section 11.2, and any action so taken or not taken shall be deemed consented to by the Lenders.

 

(b)                                 The Letter of Credit Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued hereunder and the agreements and documents associated therewith.  The Letter of Credit Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agents in this Article 14 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it, or proposed to be issued by it, and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent”, “Collateral Agent” or “Agent”, as the case may be, as used in this Article 14 included the Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the Letter of Credit Issuer.

 

Section 14.2                                Delegation of Duties.  Each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees, or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  Neither Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 

Section 14.3                                Liability of the Agents.  None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this

 

147







 

Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Credit Provider or Participant for any recital, statement, representation, or warranty made by any Obligated Party or any Affiliate of any Obligated Party, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement, or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Obligated Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.  No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or Participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books, or records of any Obligated Party or any Obligated Party’s Affiliates.

 

Section 14.4                                Reliance by the Agents.  Each of the Agents shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex, or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement, or other document or conversation believed by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent, or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Obligated Party or any of their respective Affiliates), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent.  Each of the Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders, the Majority Revolving Lenders, the Majority Term Lenders, the Supermajority Revolving Lenders, all the Lenders, all the Revolving Lenders or all the Term Lenders, as appropriate, as the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.  The Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority Revolving Lenders or, after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders (or all Lenders, all Revolving Lenders, all Term Lenders, the Majority Lenders or the Supermajority Revolving Lenders, as appropriate, if so required by Article 13) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders.  For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 9.1, each Lender that has executed and delivered this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved, or accepted, or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by, or acceptable or satisfactory to, a Lender unless each Agent shall have received written notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.

 

Section 14.5                                Notice of Default.  Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, other than the failure of the

 

148







 

Borrowers to make any payment of principal, interest, fees, or expenses required to be paid to it for the benefit of the Credit Providers, unless the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall have received written notice from an Obligated Party or a Lender referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.”  The Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.  The Collateral Agent and/or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be directed by the Majority Revolving Lenders (or the Majority Lenders or the Majority Term Lenders, as applicable) in accordance with Article 11; provided that unless and until the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, has received any such direction, the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Credit Providers.

 

Section 14.6                                Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to such Lender, and that no act by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the Obligated Parties and their Affiliates (or any of them), shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether any Agent-Related Person has disclosed material information in its possession.  Each Lender represents to the Agents that such Lender has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as such Lender has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligated Parties and their Affiliates, and any Requirement of Law relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and such Lender has made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers hereunder.  Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as such Lender shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals, and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, and creditworthiness of the Obligated Parties and their Affiliates.  Except for notices, reports, and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by either of the Agents (as applicable), neither Agent shall have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition, or creditworthiness of any Obligated Party or any of their Affiliates that may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

 

Section 14.7                                Indemnification.  WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY ARE CONSUMMATED, THE LENDERS SHALL, UPON DEMAND, INDEMNIFY THE AGENT-RELATED PERSONS (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE OBLIGATED PARTIES AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE OBLIGATION OF THE OBLIGATED PARTIES TO DO SO), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRO RATA SHARES, AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH AGENT-RELATED PERSON FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL INDEMNIFIED

 

149







 

LIABILITIES (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 15.11(a)); PROVIDED THAT NO LENDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT TO ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON OF ANY PORTION OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT DETERMINED IN A FINAL, NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO HAVE RESULTED FROM SUCH AGENT-RELATED PERSON’S OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT; PROVIDED, FURTHER, THAT NO ACTION TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTIONS OF THE MAJORITY REVOLVING LENDERS OR, IF REQUIRED BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE LENDERS, THE REVOLVING LENDERS, THE TERM LENDERS, THE MAJORITY LENDERS, THE SUPERMAJORITY REVOLVING LENDERS OR THE MAJORITY TERM LENDERS SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION.  Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers.  The undertaking in this Section 14.7 shall survive the termination of the Commitments, payment of all Obligations hereunder, and the resignation or replacement of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent.

 

Section 14.8                                The Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent in their Individual Capacity.  Each of BofA and Wachovia and their respective Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting, or other business with any Obligated Party and its Affiliates as though such Person were not the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer or the Collateral Agent hereunder, as applicable, and without notice to or consent of the Lenders.  The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, each of BofA and Wachovia and its respective Affiliates may receive information regarding any Obligated Party, its Affiliates, and Account Debtors (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of any such Obligated Party or Affiliate), and the Lenders acknowledge that BofA and Wachovia shall be under no obligation to provide such information to the Lenders.  With respect to its Loans, each of BofA and Wachovia as a Lender shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include each of BofA and Wachovia in its individual capacity.

 

Section 14.9                                Successor Agents.  Each Agent may resign as an Agent (the “resigning Agent”) upon at least 30 days’ prior notice to the other Agent, the Lenders and the Obligated Parties (and any such resignation by BofA or Wachovia shall also constitute its resignation as the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued after its resignation (the “resigning Letter of Credit Issuer”)).  In the event BofA or Wachovia sells all of its Commitment and Loans, such Person shall resign as an Agent; provided that if such sale by

 

150





 

BofA or Wachovia is as part of a sale, transfer, or other disposition by such Person of substantially all of its loan portfolio, such Person shall resign as an Agent and such purchaser or transferee shall become its successor Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder.  Subject to the foregoing, if either Agent resigns under this Agreement, then (i) effective upon the effective date of the resignation of the resigning Agent, the remaining Agent shall act (and hereby agrees to act) as the sole Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders or (ii) if there is no remaining Agent at such time, the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) shall appoint from among the Lenders the successor sole Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (any Person being appointed pursuant to this clause (ii) as successor to the resigning Agent being referred to in this Section as the “successor Agent,” and any such appointment prior to the Revolving Termination Date shall also constitute appointment of such successor Agent as the Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued after such appointment (the “successor Letter of Credit Issuer”)) for the Lenders that shall be consented to by the Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of a Default or an Event of Default (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders prior to the effective date of the resignation of the resigning Agent at a time when there is no other Agent, the resigning Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all the duties of the Agents hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) appoint the successor sole Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent as provided for in this Section 14.9.  Upon the remaining Agent becoming the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for the Lenders (as provided in clause (i) of the second preceding sentence) or the acceptance by the successor Agent of its appointment as the successor Agent hereunder (as provided in clause (ii) of the second preceding sentence), (a) the remaining Agent or such successor Agent, as applicable, shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and, if and to the extent applicable, the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, (b) the respective terms “Administrative Agent”, “Collateral Agent” and, if and to the extent applicable, “Letter of Credit Issuer” shall mean the remaining Agent or such successor Agent (as applicable) and, if and to the extent applicable, such successor Letter of Credit Issuer, (c) the resigning Agent’s appointment, rights, powers, and duties as an Agent shall be terminated, and (d) if and to the extent applicable, the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer’s appointment, rights, powers, and duties as the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, the remaining Agent or any Lender, other than the obligation of the remaining Agent or the successor Letter of Credit Issuer, as applicable, to issue Letters of Credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, issued by the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer outstanding at the time of such succession or to make other arrangements satisfactory to the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the resigning Letter of Credit Issuer with respect to its Letters of Credit.  After any resigning Agent’s resignation hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this Article 14, Section 15.7, and Section 15.11 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) on or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Collateral Agent shall resign while holding any Supporting Letters of Credit or any Supporting Cash Deposit or other cash collateral for the payment of any Obligations relating to Letters of Credit (collectively the

 

151







 

foregoing, the “Letter of Credit Security”), (y) the resigning Collateral Agent is not also acting as the Administrative Agent (or if so acting, is resigning as the Administrative Agent at the same time as it is resigning as the Collateral Agent) and (z) the resigning Collateral Agent was, at any time prior to the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, a Letter of Credit Issuer, a Revolving Lender or any affiliate of any thereof and the then Administrative Agent (if not the same Person as the resigning Collateral Agent) was not, at any time prior to the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, a Letter of Credit Issuer, a Revolving Lender or any affiliate of any thereof, then:

 

(a)                                  notwithstanding such resignation, the resigning Collateral Agent may, at its election exercised in its notice of resignation delivered under this Section 14.9, continue to act as the Collateral Agent solely with respect to the Letter of Credit Security (the Collateral Agent solely in such capacity, the “Letter of Credit Collateral Agent”) and as such (i) shall retain all of the rights, powers and duties of the Collateral Agent with respect to the Letter of Credit Security and the successor Collateral Agent, if any, to the resigning Collateral Agent shall not succeed to such rights, powers and duties with respect to the Letter of Credit Security and (ii) the provisions of this Article 14, Section 15.7 and Section 15.11 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it acted as the Collateral Agent under this Agreement (including, without limitation, with respect to the Letter of Credit Security after it resigned hereunder as Collateral Agent for all other purposes);

 

(b)                                 if the resigning Collateral Agent does not make the election described in clause (a), its notice of resignation shall, concurrently with being delivered as provided under this Section 14.9, be additionally delivered to each Letter of Credit Issuer (if other than such retiring Collateral Agent or a recipient of such notice otherwise) any of whose Letters of Credit are outstanding at such time; and

 

(c)                                  if clause (b) shall be applicable and there are outstanding any Letters of Credit issued by one or more Letter of Credit Issuers other than the resigning Collateral Agent, each such Letter of Credit Issuer may, at its election exercised by delivering written notice thereof to the resigning Collateral Agent, the other Agent, the other Letter of Credit Issuers and Ahern within 10 Business Days of its receipt of the notice of resignation described in clause (a), agree to act as the Letter of Credit Collateral Agent, in which case (i) if more than one Letter of Credit Issuer timely makes such election, the Letter of Credit Issuer so making such election with the greatest undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit issued by it shall become the Letter of Credit Collateral Agent, (ii) the resigning Collateral Agent shall, upon the effective date of its resignation, deliver the Letter of Credit Security to the Letter of Credit Collateral Agent, (iii) upon the effective date of the resignation of the resigning Collateral Agent and its compliance with clause (ii), the Letter of Credit Collateral Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the Collateral Agent with respect to the Letter of Credit Security and the successor Collateral Agent, if any, to the resigning Collateral Agent shall not succeed to such rights, powers and duties with respect to the Letter of Credit Security.

Section 14.10                          Withholding Tax.

 

(a)                                  If any Lender is a “foreign corporation, partnership, or trust” within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such Lender agrees with and in favor of the Agents, to deliver to the Agents and Ahern:

 

(i)                                     if such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under a U.S. tax treaty, two properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN before the payment of any interest in the first calendar year during which interest may be paid under this Agreement (and thereafter as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or Ahern, but only if such Lender is then lawfully permitted to do so);

 

(ii)                                  if such Lender claims that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from U.S. withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI before the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Lender during which interest may be paid under this Agreement (and thereafter as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or Ahern, but only if such Lender is then lawfully permitted to do so), and IRS Form W-9; and

 

(iii)                               such other form or forms as may be required under the Code or other laws of the U.S. as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax.

 

Such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Agents and Ahern of any change in circumstances that would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

 

(b)                                 If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax under a U.S. tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN and such Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations owing to such Lender, such Lender agrees to notify the Agents and Ahern of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations owing to such Lender.  To the extent of such percentage amount, the Agents and the Borrowers will treat such Lender’s IRS Form W-8BEN as no longer valid.

 

(c)                                  If any Lender claiming exemption from U.S. withholding tax by filing IRS Form W-8ECI with the Agents sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations owing to such Lender, such Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

 

(d)                                 If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Borrower, as appropriate, may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such reduction.  If the forms or other

 

153







 

documentation required by clause (a) preceding are not delivered to the Agents and Ahern, then the applicable Agent or any Borrower, as appropriate, may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

 

(e)                                  If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the U.S. or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that an Agent or any Borrower did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Agents or any Borrower of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify each of the Agents and any Borrower fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by any of them as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to either of the Agents or the Borrowers under this Section 14.10, together with all costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs).  The obligation of the Lenders under this clause (e) shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of either Agent.

 

Section 14.11                          Collateral Matters.

 

(a)                                  The Credit Providers hereby irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent to release any Guarantor that is permitted to wind-up, dissolve, liquidate, or merge out of existence under Section 8.9, and to release any Agent’s Liens upon any Collateral (i) upon (A) termination of the Commitments, (B) termination or collateralization as provided in Section 2.4(g) of all outstanding Letters of Credit (whether or not any of such obligations are due), and (C) the Borrowers’ payment and satisfaction in full of all Loans and other Obligations (other than indemnification obligations to the extent no claim with respect thereto has been asserted and remains unsatisfied), (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if the Obligated Party selling or disposing of such property certifies to the Agents that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with Section 8.9 (and the Agents may rely conclusively on any such certification, without further inquiry), (iii) constituting property in which no Obligated Party owned any interest at the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter, or (iv) constituting property leased to an Obligated Party under a lease that has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement.  Except as provided above, the Collateral Agent will not release any of the Agent’s Liens without the prior written authorization of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders); provided that the Collateral Agent may, in its discretion with the prior written authorization of the Administrative Agent, release the Agent’s Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $1,000,000 during each Fiscal Year without the prior written authorization of any Lender and the Collateral Agent may release the Agent’s Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $5,000,000 during each Fiscal Year with the prior written authorization of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) and the Administrative Agent; and provided, further that, notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full the Collateral Agent may not release the Agent’s Lien on any cash collateral provided under any of

 

154







 

Section 2.4(g), Section 4.3(a), clause sixth of Section 4.6(b) or Section 11.2(b) securing the payment of any Obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Majority Revolving Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuer except to pay any Obligations secured thereby or upon the termination or cancellation of all Letters of Credit and the payment in full of all Obligations with respect to all Letters of Credit.  Upon request by either of the Agents or the Obligated Parties at any time, the Credit Providers will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent’s authority to release any Guarantor and any of the Agent’s Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral in accordance with the terms of this Section 14.11.

 

(b)                                 Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of any authorization required pursuant to Section 14.11(a) from the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders) and/or the Administrative Agent (or as provided in the second proviso in the second sentence of Section 14.11(a), the Administrative Agent, the Majority Revolving Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuer), as appropriate, of the Collateral Agent’s authority to release any Agent’s Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least five Business Days prior written request by the Obligated Parties, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent’s Liens upon such Collateral; provided that (i) the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms that, in the Collateral Agent’s opinion, would expose the Collateral Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Obligated Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Obligated Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.

 

(c)                                  Neither of the Agents shall have any obligation whatsoever to any of the Credit Providers to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any of the Obligated Parties or is cared for, protected, or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent’s Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected, or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure, or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities, and powers granted or available to either of the Agents pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission, or event related thereto, each of the Agents may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given such Agent’s own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that neither of the Agents shall have any other duty or liability whatsoever to any Credit Provider as to any of the foregoing.

 

(d)                                 Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of any proceeds of Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall promptly turn all such proceeds over to the Administrative Agent for application in accordance with Section 4.6(b).

 

155



 





 

Section 14.12                        Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments.

 

(a)                                  Each of the Credit Providers agrees that it shall not, without the express consent of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders), and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the request of the Majority Revolving Lenders (or after the Revolving Facility Payment In Full, the Majority Term Lenders), setoff against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Credit Provider to any Obligated Party or any accounts of any Obligated Party now or hereafter maintained with such Credit Provider.  Each of the Credit Providers further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by the Agents, take or cause to be taken any action to enforce its rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or against any Obligated Party, including the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral.

 

(b)                                 If at any time or times any Credit Provider shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff, or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations owing to such Credit Provider arising under, or relating to, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Credit Provider from either of the Agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from either of the Agents in excess of such Credit Provider’s ratable portion of all such distributions by the Agents with respect to the applicable Obligations, such Credit Provider shall promptly (A) turn the same over to the Administrative Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Administrative Agent, or in same day funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the applicable Credit Providers and for application to the applicable Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (B) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the applicable Obligations owed to the other applicable Credit Providers so that such excess payment received shall be applied among the applicable Credit Providers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment.

 

Section 14.13                        Agency for Perfection.  Each Credit Provider hereby appoints each other Credit Provider as agent for the purpose of perfecting Liens, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, in assets that, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC or any other Requirement of Law, can be perfected only by possession.  Should any Credit Provider (other than the Collateral Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Credit Provider shall notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Collateral Agent’s request therefor, shall deliver such Collateral to the Collateral Agent or otherwise deal with such Collateral in accordance with the Collateral Agent’s instructions.

 

156







 

Section 14.14                        Payments by Agents to the Lenders.  All payments to be made by either of the Agents to the Credit Providers shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of immediately available funds to each Credit Provider pursuant to transfer instructions delivered in writing to the Agents on or prior to the Closing Date (or if such Credit Provider is an Assignee, delivered with or in the applicable Assignment and Acceptance), or pursuant to such other transfer instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to the Agents.  Concurrently with each such payment, the applicable Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium, interest, or fees on the Revolving Loans, Term Loans, the Letters of Credit, or otherwise.  Unless the Agents receive notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Credit Provider that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, each of the Agents may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in full to the applicable Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the applicable Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each applicable Credit Provider on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Credit Provider.  If and to the extent the Borrowers have not made such payment in full to the applicable Agent, each applicable Credit Provider shall repay to such Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Credit Provider, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Credit Provider until the date repaid.

 

Section 14.15                        Settlement.

 

(a)                                  Each Revolving Lender’s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Revolving Lenders to be equal at all times to such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans.  Notwithstanding such agreement, the Agents, BofA, Wachovia, and the Revolving Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of or enforceable by the Obligated Parties or the Term Lenders) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among them as to the Revolving Loans, including the Non-Ratable Loans and the Agent Advances, shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:

 

(i)                                     The Administrative Agent shall request settlement (a “Settlement”) with the Revolving Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis at its election, (A) on behalf of BofA, with respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, (B) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance, and (C) with respect to collections received, in each case, by notifying the Revolving Lenders of such requested Settlement by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 1:30 p.m. (New York time) on the date of such requested Settlement (the “Settlement Date”).  In its discretion, the Administrative Agent may on any Settlement Date permit Non-Ratable Loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) to remain outstanding, while requiring Settlement of the other outstanding Non-Ratable Loans.  Each Revolving Lender (other than BofA, in the case of the Non-Ratable Loans, and the Administrative Agent, in the case of the Agent Advances) shall transfer the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the outstanding principal amount of the Non-Ratable Loans and

 

157







 

Agent Advances with respect to which Settlement is requested to the Administrative Agent to such account of the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may designate, not later than 4:00 p.m. (New York time), on the Settlement Date applicable thereto.  Settlements shall occur during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default and whether or not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 have then been satisfied.  Such amounts transferred to the Administrative Agent shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance for which the Administrative Agent has requested Settlement and, together with the portion of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance representing BofA’s (in its individual capacity or as the Administrative Agent, as appropriate) Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lenders, respectively.  If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent by any Revolving Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three days from and after the Settlement Date and thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans (Y) on behalf of BofA, with respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan and (Z) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance.

 

(ii)                                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than one Business Day after demand is made by the Administrative Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default and regardless of whether it has requested a Settlement with respect to a Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance), each other Revolving Lender (A) shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and receive from BofA or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance equal to such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance, and (B) if Settlement has not previously occurred with respect to such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances, upon demand by BofA or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall pay to BofA or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, as the purchase price of such participation an amount equal to 100% of such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances.  If such amount is not in fact transferred to BofA or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, by any Revolving Lender, BofA or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three days from and after such demand and thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans.

 

(iii)                               From and after the date, if any, on which any Revolving Lender purchases an undivided interest and participation in any Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance pursuant to clause (ii) preceding, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Revolving Lender, such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral

 

158







 

received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance.

 

(iv)                              Between Settlement Dates, to the extent no Agent Advances are outstanding, the Administrative Agent may pay over to BofA any payments received by the Administrative Agent which in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Revolving Loans of BofA, including Non-Ratable Loans.  If, as of any Settlement Date, collections received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to the Revolving Loans of BofA (other than to Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances in which a Revolving Lender has not yet funded its purchase of a participation pursuant to clause (ii) preceding), as provided for in the previous sentence, BofA shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the accounts of the Revolving Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lenders, an amount such that each Revolving Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans.  During the period between Settlement Dates, BofA with respect to Non-Ratable Loans, the Administrative Agent with respect to Agent Advances, and each Revolving Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of funds employed by BofA, the Administrative Agent and the other Revolving Lenders.

 

(v)                                 Unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Revolving Lender to the contrary, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied on any Funding Date for a Revolving Loan or Non-Ratable Loan.  Unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Revolving Lender to the contrary or the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary (based solely on the Borrowing Base Certificate most recently delivered to it), the Administrative Agent may assume that the requested Borrowing will not exceed the Unused Availability on any Funding Date for a Revolving Loan or Non-Ratable Loan.

 

(b)                                 The Lenders’ Failure to Perform.  All Revolving Loans (other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Revolving Lenders simultaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.  It is understood that (i) no Revolving Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Revolving Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, nor shall any Revolving Credit Commitment of any Revolving Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Revolving Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) no failure by any Revolving Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder shall excuse any other Revolving Lender from its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Revolving Lender hereunder shall be several, not joint and several.

 

159







 

(c)                                  Defaulting Lenders.  Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Closing Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to it in immediately available funds on the Funding Date.  Furthermore, the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers on such date a corresponding amount.  If any Lender has not transferred its full Pro Rata Share to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and if the Administrative Agent has transferred a corresponding amount to the Borrowers on the Business Day following such Funding Date, the applicable Lender shall make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for that day.  A notice by the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.  If each Lender’s full Pro Rata Share is transferred to the Administrative Agent as required, the amount transferred to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan or Term Loan, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement.  If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Administrative Agent will notify the Borrowers of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for its account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans or Term Loans, as applicable, comprising that particular Borrowing.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any Funding Date (any such Lender, prior to the cure of such failure, being referred to herein as a “Defaulting Lender”) shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Loan on such Funding Date.  No Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to advance such other Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing.

 

(d)                                 Retention of Defaulting Lender’s Payments.  Neither of the Agents shall be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by any Borrower to such Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit, nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder.  Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by the Administrative Agent.  In its discretion with respect to a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent may loan the Borrowers the amount of all such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender.  Any amounts so loaned to the Borrowers shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans and for all other purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if they were Revolving Loans.  For purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro Rata Shares, a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a “Lender.”  Until a Defaulting Lender that is a Revolving Lender cures its failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing (i) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to any portion of the Unused Line Fee and (ii) the Unused Line Fee shall accrue in favor of the Revolving Lenders that have funded their respective Pro Rata Shares of such requested Borrowing and shall be allocated among such performing Revolving Lenders ratably based upon their relative

 

160







 

Revolving Credit Commitments.  This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender until such time as the Defaulting Lender shall no longer be in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement.  The terms of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, or relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder.

 

(e)                                  Removal of Defaulting Lender.  At the Borrowers’ request, each Agent (acting in its individual capacity as a Lender) or an Eligible Assignee reasonably acceptable to the Agents and the Borrowers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to purchase from any Defaulting Lender, and each Defaulting Lender shall, upon such request, sell and assign to such Agent (acting in its individual capacity as a Lender) or such Eligible Assignee (as applicable), all of the Defaulting Lender’s outstanding Loans and Commitments hereunder.  Such sale shall be consummated promptly after the applicable Agent or one or more of the Borrowers, as applicable, has arranged for a purchase by such Agent (acting in its individual capacity as a Lender) or an Eligible Assignee (as applicable) pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, and at a price equal to the outstanding principal balance of the Defaulting Lender’s Loans, plus accrued interest and fees (excluding the Unused Line Fee to the extent not required to be paid to the Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 14.15(d)), without premium or discount.

 

Section 14.16                        Letters of Credit; Intra-Revolving Lender Issues.

 

(a)                                  Notice of Letter of Credit Balance.  On each Settlement Date, either or both of the Agents shall notify each Revolving Lender of the issuance of any Letters of Credit since the prior Settlement Date.

 

(b)                                 Participations in Letters of Credit.

 

(i)                                     Purchase of Participations.  Immediately upon issuance of any Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.4(d), each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation equal to such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the face amount of such Letter of Credit in connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit (including all obligations of the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto).

 

(ii)                                  Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments.  Whenever the Administrative Agent receives a payment from a Borrower on account of reimbursement obligations in respect of a Letter of Credit as to which the Administrative Agent has previously received for its account or the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer payment from a Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent shall pay to such Revolving Lender such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such payment from such Borrower.  Each such payment shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the next Settlement Date.

 

161







 

(iii)                               Documentation.  Upon the request of any Revolving Lender, the Letter of Credit Issuer shall furnish to either of the Agents and such Agent shall furnish to such Revolving Lender copies of any Letter of Credit, reimbursement agreements executed in connection therewith, applications for any Letter of Credit, and such other documentation relating to such Letter of Credit as may reasonably be requested by such Revolving Lender.

 

(iv)                              Obligations Irrevocable.  The obligation of each Revolving Lender to make payments to the Administrative Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit or with respect to its participation therein or with respect to the Revolving Loans made as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit and the obligation of the Borrowers to make payments to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Lenders, with respect to any Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever, including any of the following circumstances:

 

(A)                              any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents;

 

(B)                                the existence of any claim, setoff, defense, or other right that any Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Lender, either Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuer, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transactions between such Borrower or any other Person and the beneficiary named in any Letter of Credit);

 

(C)                                any draft, certificate, or other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

 

(D)                               the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;

 

(E)                                 the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or

 

(F)                                 the failure of the Borrowers to satisfy the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 9.

 

(v)                                 Claims Against Letter of Credit Issuer.  Nothing in this Section 14.16 shall prohibit a Revolving Lender from seeking to recover any payment made by such Revolving Lender to or for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuer that constituted reimbursement of (or the funding of its Pro Rata Share of) a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the honor of which drawing

constitutes the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Issuer as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment.

 

(c)                                  Recovery or Avoidance of Payments; Refund of Payments in Error.  In the event any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower received by the Administrative Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit and distributed by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders on account of their respective participations therein is thereafter set aside, avoided, or recovered from the Administrative Agent or the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with any receivership, liquidation, or bankruptcy proceeding, the Revolving Lenders shall, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent their respective Pro Rata Shares of such amount set aside, avoided, or recovered, together with interest at the rate required to be paid by the Administrative Agent or the Letter of Credit Issuer upon the amount required to be repaid by it.  Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Revolving Lenders that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in full to it on such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Revolving Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Revolving Lender.  If and to the extent the Borrowers have not made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Revolving Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Revolving Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Revolving Lender until the date repaid.

 

(d)                                 Indemnification by the Lenders.  To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, the Revolving Lenders agree to indemnify the Letter of Credit Issuer ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Letter of Credit Issuer in any way relating to or arising out of any Letter of Credit or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document in connection therewith; provided that no Revolving Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the Letter of Credit Issuer’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limiting the foregoing, each Revolving Lender agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or expenses payable by any Borrower to the Letter of Credit Issuer to the extent that the Letter of Credit Issuer is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by a Borrower.  The agreement contained in this Section shall survive payment in full of all other Obligations.

(b)                                 expressly agrees and acknowledges that none of BofA, Wachovia or either of the Agents (i) makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report or (ii) shall be liable for any information contained in any Report;

Section 14.21                        Co-Lead Arrangers and Syndication Agent.  Each of the Co-Lead Arrangers and the Syndication Agent, solely in its capacity as such, shall have no obligations, liabilities, responsibilities or duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Co-Lead Arrangers and the Syndication Agent shall have no fiduciary relationship with any Credit Provider and each Credit Provider acknowledges that it has not

Section 15.12                          Limitation of Liability.  NO CLAIM MAY BE MADE BY ANY OBLIGATED PARTY, THE COLLATERAL AGENT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY OTHER CREDIT PROVIDER, OR ANY OTHER PERSON AGAINST ANY OBLIGATED PARTY, THE COLLATERAL AGENT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY OTHER CREDIT PROVIDER, OR ANY AFFILIATE, DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, COUNSEL, REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT OF ANY OF THEM FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION, OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AND EACH OBLIGATED PARTY, THE COLLATERAL AGENT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND EACH OTHER CREDIT PROVIDER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, AND AGREES NOT TO SUE UPON ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR.

 

Section 15.13                        Final Agreement.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are intended by the Obligated Parties, the Agents, and the Lenders to be the final, complete, and

 

174







 

exclusive expression of the agreement between them.  This Agreement and the other Loan Documents supersede any and all prior oral or written agreements relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof (including, without limitation, the terms of the Original Loan and Security Agreement and the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement).  No modification, rescission, waiver, release, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made, except in accordance with Article 13.

 

Section 15.14                          Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, each Lender, and each Obligated Party in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same agreement.  Signature pages to this Agreement may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document and a telecopy or electronic transmission (in pdf format) of any such executed signature page shall be valid as an original.

 

Section 15.15                          Right of Setoff.  In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or any or all of the Loans have been accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Obligated Party, any such notice being waived by the Obligated Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Obligated Party against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not either Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Obligated Parties and the Agents after any such setoff and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO LENDER SHALL EXERCISE ANY RIGHT OF SETOFF, BANKER’S LIEN, OR THE LIKE AGAINST ANY DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY OF ANY OBLIGATED PARTY HELD OR MAINTAINED BY SUCH LENDER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE MAJORITY REVOLVING LENDERS (OR AFTER THE REVOLVING FACILITY PAYMENT IN FULL, THE MAJORITY TERM LENDERS).

 

Section 15.16                          Confidentiality.

 

(a)           Each Obligated Party hereby consents that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and each Lender may issue and disseminate to the public general information describing the credit accommodation entered into pursuant to this Agreement, including the name and address of the Obligated Parties and a general description of the Obligated Parties’ business and may use each Obligated Party’s name in advertising and other promotional material.

 

(b)           Each Lender severally agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as “confidential” or “secret” by any Obligated Party and provided to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Lender by or on behalf of any Obligated Party under

 

175







 

this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent that such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or a Lender or (ii) was or becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than an Obligated Party, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with an Obligated Party known to the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Lender; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may disclose such information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Lender is subject or in connection with an examination of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Lender by any such Governmental Authority, (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process, (C) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law, (D) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding (including any bankruptcy proceeding) to which the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates may be party, (E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (F) to the Collateral Agent’s, the Administrative Agent’s or such Lender’s independent auditors, accountants, attorneys, and other professional advisors, (G) to any prospective Participant or Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such prospective Participant or Assignee agrees to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder, (H) as expressly permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which any Obligated Party is party or is deemed party with the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and (I) to its Affiliates.  Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

 

Section 15.17                          USA Patriot Act Notice.  Each Lender and each Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Obligated Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, such Credit Provider is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies the Obligated Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Obligated Parties and other information that will allow such Credit Provider to identify the Obligated Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act.

 

Section 15.18                          Joint and Several Liability.  All Loans, upon funding, shall be deemed to be jointly funded to and received by the Borrowers.  Each Borrower jointly and severally agrees to pay, and shall be jointly and severally liable under this Agreement for, all Obligations, regardless of the manner or amount in which proceeds of Loans are used, allocated, shared, or disbursed by or among the Borrowers themselves, or the manner in which either Agent and/or any Lender accounts for such Loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records.  Each Borrower shall be liable for all amounts due to either of the Agents and/or any Lender under this Agreement, regardless of which Borrower actually receives Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or the amount of such Loans and extensions of credit received or the manner in which such Agent and/or such Lender accounts for such Loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records.  Each Borrower’s Obligations with respect to Loans and other extensions of credit

 

176





 

made to it, and such Borrower’s Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of such Borrower hereunder, with respect to Loans made to the other Borrowers hereunder, shall be separate and distinct obligations, but all such Obligations shall be primary obligations of such Borrower.  The Borrowers acknowledge and expressly agree with each Agent and each Lender that the joint and several liability of each Borrower is required solely as a condition to, and is given solely as inducement for and in consideration of, credit or accommodations extended or to be extended under the Loan Documents to any or all of the other Borrowers and is not required or given as a condition of extensions of credit to such Borrower.  Each Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement and as an obligor under a Guaranty Agreement shall be separate and distinct obligations.  Each Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be unconditional irrespective of (a) the validity or enforceability, avoidance, or subordination of any of the Obligations of any other Borrower or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any part of the Obligations of any other Borrower, (b) the absence of any attempt to collect any of the Obligations from any other Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same, (c) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance, or granting of any indulgence by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and/or any Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument evidencing any of the Obligations of any other Borrower or Guarantor, or any part thereof, or any other agreement now or hereafter executed by any other Borrower or Guarantor and delivered to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and/or any Lender, (d) the failure by the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender to take any steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or collateral for any of the Obligations of any other Borrower or Guarantor, (e) the Administrative Agent’s, the Collateral Agent’s and/or any Lender’s election, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy Code, or the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (f) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (g) the disallowance of all or any portion of the Administrative Agent’s, the Collateral Agent’s and/or any Lender’s claim(s) for the repayment of any of the Obligations of any other Borrower under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (h) any other circumstances that might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor or of any other Borrower.  With respect to any Borrower’s Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder with respect to Loans or other extensions of credit made to any of the other Borrowers hereunder, such Borrower waives, until the Obligations shall have been paid in full and this Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce any right of subrogation or any remedy that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and/or any Lender now has or may hereafter have against any other Borrower, any endorser or any Guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and/or any other Credit Provider to secure payment of the Obligations or any other liability of any Borrower to any other Credit Provider.  Upon any Event of Default, either of the Agents may proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Borrower to collect and recover the full amount, or any portion of the Obligations, without first proceeding against any other Borrower or any other Person, or against any security or collateral for any of the Obligations.  Each Borrower consents and agrees that neither the Collateral Agent nor the Administrative Agent shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Borrower or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations.

 

177







 

Section 15.19                          Contribution and Indemnification among the Obligated Parties.  Each Borrower is obligated to repay the Obligations as joint and several obligors under this Agreement.  To the extent that any Borrower shall, under this Agreement as a joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting Loans made to another Borrower hereunder or other Obligations incurred directly and primarily by any other Borrower and to the extent any other Obligated Party makes any transfer (including any payment, grant, guaranty, or granting of a Lien) pursuant to this Agreement (any such payment or transfer being referred to herein as an “Accommodation Payment”), then the Obligated Party making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Obligated Parties in an amount, for each of such other Obligated Parties, equal to a fraction of such Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Obligated Party’s Allocable Amount and the denominator of which is the sum of the Allocable Amounts of all of the Obligated Parties.  As of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of each Obligated Party shall be equal to the maximum amount of liability for Accommodation Payments that could be asserted against such Obligated Party hereunder without (a) rendering such Obligated Party “insolvent” within the meaning of Section 101 (32) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (“UFCA”), (b) leaving such Obligated Party with unreasonably small capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (c) leaving such Obligated Party unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA.  All rights and claims of contribution, indemnification, and reimbursement under this Section shall be subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations.  The provisions of this Section shall, to the extent expressly inconsistent with any provision in any Loan Document, supersede such inconsistent provision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement shall limit the liability or obligation of any Person (the “subject Person”) with respect to any indebtedness, liabilities, or obligations of any Subsidiary of the subject Person.

 

Section 15.20                          Agency of Ahern for Each Other Obligated Party.  Each of the Obligated Parties (excluding Ahern) irrevocably appoints Ahern as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement, including the giving and receipt of notices and execution and delivery of all documents, instruments, and certificates contemplated herein (including execution and delivery to the Agents of Borrowing Base Certificates) and all modifications hereto.  Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification, or other action that might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all or any of the Obligated Parties or acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by Ahern, whether or not any of the other Obligated Parties joins therein, and the Agents and the Lenders shall have no duty or obligation to make further inquiry with respect to the authority of Ahern under this Section 15.20, provided that nothing in this Section 15.20 shall limit the effectiveness of, or the right of the Agents and the Lenders to rely upon, any notice, document, instrument, certificate, acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification, or other action delivered by any Obligated Party pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 15.21                          Additional Borrowers and Guarantors.  Addition of any Person as a Borrower or a Guarantor to this Agreement is subject to approval of all of the Revolving Lenders (in the case of a Borrower) or the Majority Revolving Lenders (in the case of a Guarantor), and

 

178







 

may be conditioned upon such requirements as they may determine in their discretion, including (a) the furnishing of such financial and other information as any such Lender may reasonably request, (b) approval by all appropriate approval authorities of each such Lender, and (c) execution and delivery by the Obligated Parties, such Person, the Agents and the Majority Revolving Lenders or other requisite Lenders (as appropriate) of such agreements and other documentation (including a Guaranty Agreement and an amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document), and the furnishing by such Person or any of the Obligated Parties of such certificates, opinions, and other documentation, as either of the Agents or any such Lender may reasonably request.  No Lender shall have any obligation to approve any such Person for addition as a party to this Agreement.

 

Section 15.22                          Express Waivers By the Obligated Parties In Respect of Cross Guaranties and Cross Collateralization.  Each Obligated Party agrees as follows:

 

(a)           Each Obligated Party hereby waives:  (i) notice of acceptance of this Agreement; (ii) notice of the making of any Loans, the issuance of any Letter of Credit, or any other financial accommodations made or extended under the Loan Documents or the creation or existence of any Obligations; (iii) notice of the amount of the Obligations, subject, however, to such Obligated Party’s right to make inquiry of the Administrative Agent to ascertain the amount of the Obligations at any reasonable time; (iv) notice of any adverse change in the financial condition of any other Obligated Party or of any other fact that might increase such Obligated Party’s risk with respect to such other Obligated Party under the Loan Documents; (v) notice of presentment for payment, demand, protest, and notice thereof as to any promissory notes or other instruments among the Loan Documents; and (vii) all other notices (except if such notice is specifically required to be given to such Obligated Party hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents to which such Obligated Party is a party) and demands to which such Obligated Party might otherwise be entitled.

 

(b)           Each Obligated Party hereby waives the right by statute or otherwise to require any Credit Provider to institute suit against any other Obligated Party or to exhaust any rights and remedies that any Credit Provider has or may have against any other Obligated Party.  Each Obligated Party further waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any other Obligated Party (other than the defense that the Obligations shall have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid) or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any such Obligated Party in respect thereof.

 

(c)           Each Obligated Party hereby waives and agrees not to assert against any Credit Provider:  (i) any defense (legal or equitable), setoff, counterclaim, or claim that such Obligated Party may now or at any time hereafter have against any other Obligated Party or any other party liable under any of the Loan Documents; (ii) any defense, setoff, counterclaim, or claim of any kind or nature available to any other Obligated Party against any Credit Provider, arising directly or indirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of any of the Obligations or any security therefor; (iii) any right or defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any Credit Provider under any Requirement of

 

179







 

Law; or (iv) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting any other Obligated Party’s liability hereunder.

 

(d)           Each Obligated Party consents and agrees that, without notice to or by such Obligated Party and without affecting or impairing the obligations of such Obligated Party hereunder, each of the Agents may (subject to any requirement for consent of any of the Lenders to the extent required by this Agreement), by action or inaction:  (i) compromise, settle, extend the duration or the time for the payment of, or discharge the performance of, or may refuse to or otherwise not enforce the Loan Documents; (ii) release all or any one or more parties to any one or more of the Loan Documents or grant other indulgences to any other Obligated Party in respect thereof; (iii) amend or modify in any manner and at any time (or from time to time) any of the Loan Documents; or (iv) release or substitute any Person liable for payment of any of the Obligations, or enforce, exchange, release, or waive any security for any of the Obligations or any Guaranty of the Obligations.

 

Each Obligated Party represents and warrants that such Obligated Party is currently informed of the financial condition of all other Obligated Parties and all other circumstances that a diligent inquiry would reveal and that bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations.  Each Obligated Party further represents and warrants that such Obligated Party has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents.  Each Obligated Party agrees that no Credit Provider has any responsibility to inform any Obligated Party of the financial condition of any other Obligated Party or of any other circumstances that bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations.

 

Section 15.23                          Intercreditor Agreement.  EACH CREDIT PROVIDER HEREBY GRANTS TO THE COLLATERAL AGENT ALL REQUISITE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO OR OTHERWISE BECOME BOUND BY THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (AND AN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH ANY REFINANCING SECOND LIEN DEBT) AND TO BIND THE CREDIT PROVIDERS THERETO BY THE COLLATERAL AGENT’S ENTERING INTO OR OTHERWISE BECOMING BOUND THEREBY, AND NO FURTHER CONSENT OR APPROVAL ON THE PART OF THE CREDIT PROVIDERS IS OR WILL BE REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (OR ANY INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH ANY REFINANCING SECOND LIEN DEBT).

 

Section 15.24                          Consent to Amendment of Certain Loan Documents.  Each of the Lenders and the Agents hereby consents to the amendments to the other Loan Documents contemplated under Section 9.1.

 

180







 

Section 15.25                          Term Loan Obligations.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the Term Loan Obligations are not contractually subordinate in right of payment to the Revolving Obligations and that the Credit Providers have merely agreed in this Agreement as to the order of distribution of Collateral and proceeds of Collateral to the various Obligations.

 

Section 15.26                          Retention of Consultant.  In the event that Unused Availability shall fall below $15,000,000, either Agent may, or at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders the Administrative Agent shall, retain (either directly or through its counsel or other representative) and thereafter maintain for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders a consultant reasonably satisfactory to the Agents for contingency/bankruptcy planning and restructuring opportunities (the expense of which the Borrowers agree to pay); provided that in addition to (and not in lieu of) retaining and maintaining the foregoing consultant for such purposes, either Agent may, or at the direction of the Majority Revolving Lenders the Administrative Agent shall, retain (either directly or through its counsel or other representative) and thereafter maintain a consultant for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders reasonably satisfactory to the Agents to consult with the Agents and the Revolving Lenders on a limited scope reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent (the expense of which the Borrowers also agree to pay).  Any written information provided by such consultant to the Agents or the Revolving Lenders that the Agents and their respective counsel determine are not protected by the attorney-client privilege as to the Revolving Lenders shall be provided to any Term Lender upon its written request to both Agents.

 

Section 15.27                          Reaffirmation and Grant of Security Interests.

 

(a)           Each Obligated Party hereby acknowledges that it has (i) guarantied the Obligations (other than, in the case of a Borrower, such Borrower’s Obligations) and (ii) created, under Section 10.1 and under certain of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, on certain Collateral to secure its Obligations hereunder.  Each Obligated Party hereby acknowledges that it has reviewed the terms and provisions of this Agreement and consents to the amendment and restatement of the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement effected pursuant to this Agreement.  Each Obligated Party hereby (i) confirms that each Loan Document to which it is a party or is otherwise bound continues to be in full force and effect as amended hereby (if applicable) and all Collateral encumbered thereby will continue to secure, to the fullest extent possible in accordance with the Loan Documents and subject to the last sentence of Section 10.1, the payment and performance of the Obligations, including without limitation the payment and performance of all such Obligations, which are joint and several obligations of each Obligated Party now or hereafter existing, and (ii) subject to the last sentence of Section 10.1, grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Credit Providers, a continuing lien on and security interest in and to such Obligated Party’s right, title and interest in, to and under all Collateral as collateral security for the prompt payment and performance in full when due of the Obligations (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise).

 

(b)           Each Obligated Party acknowledges and agrees that any of the Loan Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound shall continue in full force and effect

 

181





 

as amended hereby (if applicable) and that all of its Obligations thereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be impaired or limited by the execution or effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement.  Each Obligated Party represents and warrants that all representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents to which it is a party or otherwise bound are true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date to the same extent as though made on and as of that date, except to the extent such representations and warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true, correct and complete in all material respects on and as of such earlier date.

 

Section 15.28         Amendment and Restatement.

 

It is the intention of each of the parties hereto that the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement be amended and restated so as to preserve the perfection and priority of all security interests securing indebtedness and obligations of the Obligated Parties under the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement and that all indebtedness and obligations of the Borrowers and the other Obligated Parties hereunder and thereunder shall be equally and ratably secured by the Loan Documents (except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of Section 10.1) and that this Agreement does not constitute a novation of the obligations and liabilities of the Obligated Parties existing under the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement.  The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement constitutes an amendment of the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement made under and in accordance with the terms of Section 13.1 of the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement.  In addition, unless specifically amended hereby, each of the Loan Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules to the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and that, from and after the Closing Date, all references to the “Loan Agreement” contained therein shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement.
