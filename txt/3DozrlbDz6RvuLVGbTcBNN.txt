Bonus Amount:



 

Bonus amount =

Salary x Incentive Level x (Financial Factor Multiplier + Personal Objective Multiplier)



Note:



This Incentive Plan (“Plan”) is not a contract that entitles you to an award if the Plan objectives for the fiscal year are met; rather, this Plan is a discretionary short term cash bonus plan administered by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). The Committee retains the sole and absolute discretion to deny and not pay bonuses under the Plan and to reduce bonuses payable under the Plan, notwithstanding the attainment of objectives under the Plan; to increase or pay bonuses under the Plan, even if the objectives under the Plan have not been met; and to further condition, modify or amend the objectives and conditions of eligibility under the Plan. The Committee also retains the sole discretion with respect to awards to be paid, if any, in connection with separations from employment that occur during a Plan year.
