The Company has duly authorized the execution, delivery and performance of each of the Note Documents. The Note Documents conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.

          (i) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries are duly qualified or licensed by and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of their respective businesses or their respective ownership or leasing of their respective properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined herein). Other than the entities listed on Schedule II hereto, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any shares of stock or any other equity or long-term debt securities of any corporation or have any equity interest in any firm, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity other than the entities listed on Schedule III hereto. A “Material Adverse Effect” means any material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or other), results of operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (j) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company.

          (k) The Indenture, when duly executed and delivered by the Company (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee), will be a legally binding and valid obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought (collectively, the “Enforceability Exceptions”).

          (l) The Securities, when issued, authenticated and delivered by the Company against payment by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indenture, will be legally binding and valid obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that

12





 





enforceability thereof may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions, and will conform to the description thereof contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus.

          (m) When the Securities are delivered and paid for pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date and any settlement date, the Securities will be convertible into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Underlying Shares have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance upon such conversion and, when issued upon such conversion pursuant to the terms of the Indenture will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar right. The Rights have been duly authorized by the Company. Unless the Rights Agreement shall have been terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Rights attached to the outstanding shares of Common Stock have been validly issued, and, if and when issued in accordance with the Rights Agreement upon issuance of the Securities, the Rights attached to the Securities will be validly issued.

There exists no condition that, with notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default by the Company or any Subsidiary under any such document or instrument or result in the imposition of any penalty or the acceleration of any indebtedness, other than penalties, defaults or conditions that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

13





 





          (p) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Note Documents, including the consummation of the offer and sale of the Securities and the issuance of the Underlying Shares upon conversion thereof in accordance with the Indenture, does not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of or a default (or an event that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or require consent under, or result in the creation or imposition of a lien, charge or encumbrance on any property or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, (A) the charter, bylaws, limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement, operating agreement or other constitutive documents of the Company or any Subsidiary, (B) any of the Agreements and Instruments, (C) any law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective assets or properties or (D) any judgment, order or decree of any domestic or foreign court or governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective assets or properties. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration, qualification, license or permit of or with, any court or governmental agency, body or administrative agency, domestic or foreign, is required to be obtained or made by the Company or any Subsidiary for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement or any of the other Note Documents including the consummation of the offer and sale of the Securities and the issuance of the Underlying Shares upon conversion thereof in accordance with the Indenture, except such as have been or will be obtained or made on or prior to the Closing Date. No consents or waivers from any other person or entity are required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the issuance and sale of the Securities.

          (q) Except as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, there is (A) no action, suit or proceeding before or by any court, arbitrator or governmental agency, body or official, domestic or foreign, now pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated, to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be a party or to which the business, assets or property of such person is or may be subject, (B) no statute, rule, regulation or order that has been enacted, adopted or issued or, to the knowledge of the Company, that has been proposed by any governmental body or agency, domestic or foreign, (C) no injunction, restraining order or order of any nature by a federal or state court or foreign court of competent jurisdiction to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may be subject that (x) in the case of clause (A) above, if determined adversely to the Company or any Subsidiary, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected, (1) to have a Material Adverse Effect or (2) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Securities in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by any of the Note Documents and (y) in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected, (1) to have a Material Adverse Effect or (2) to interfere with or adversely affect the issuance of the Securities in any jurisdiction or adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Note Documents. Every request of any securities authority or agency of any jurisdiction for additional information with respect to the Securities that has been received by the Company or any Subsidiary or their counsel prior to the date hereof has been, or will prior to the Closing Date be, complied with in all material respects.

          (r) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no labor problem or dispute with the employees of the Company or the Subsidiaries exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened or imminent.

14





 





          (s) The business, operations and facilities of the Company and each of the Subsidiaries have been and are being conducted in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, licenses, permits, approvals, plans, authorizations or requirements relating to occupational safety and health, or pollution, or protection of health or the environment, or reclamation (including, without limitation, those relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of pollutants, contaminants or hazardous or toxic substances, materials or wastes into ambient air, surface water, groundwater or land, or relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of chemical substances, materials or wastes, whether solid, gaseous or liquid in nature) or otherwise relating to remediating real property of any governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality of the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, or any foreign jurisdiction, and all applicable judicial or administrative agency or regulatory decrees, awards, judgments and orders relating thereto, except any violation thereof which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and, except as disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice from a governmental instrumentality or any third party alleging any violation thereof or liability thereunder (including, without limitation, liability for costs of investigating or remediating sites containing hazardous substances and/or damages to natural resources).

          (t) There is no claim pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated under any federal, state, local or foreign law, rule, regulation, decision or order governing pollution or protection or restoration of the environment (the “Environmental Laws”) against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; there are no past or present actions or conditions including, without limitation, the use, disposal or release of, or human exposure to, any hazardous or toxic substance or waste regulated under any Environmental Law that are likely to form the basis of any such claim against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary maintain a system of internal environmental management controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of compliance in all material respects of their business facilities, real property and operations with requirements of applicable Environmental Laws.

          (u) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has all necessary permits, licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals and has made all necessary filings required under any federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation or rule, and has obtained all necessary authorizations, consents and approvals from other persons, material to the conduct of its respective business. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is in violation of, or in default under, any such license, authorization, consent or approval or any federal, state, local or foreign law, regulation or rule or any decree, order judgment applicable to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries the effect of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (v) All legal or governmental proceedings, contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus pursuant to Regulation S-K have been so described as required.

          (x) The Company and the Subsidiaries have good title to all properties and assets owned by them and have good leasehold interest in each property and asset leased by them, in each case free and clear of all pledges, liens, encumbrances, security interests, charges, mortgages and defects, except for liens permitted under the Credit Agreement and the Indenture or such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect or do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made or proposed to be made of such properties by the Company or the Subsidiaries.

          (y) The Company and each Subsidiary have, own, possess or have the right to employ all patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names and other intellectual property (collectively, the “Intellectual Property”) necessary to conduct the businesses operated by them as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package, except where the failure to own, possess or have the right to employ such Intellectual Property could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with (and neither knows of any such infringement or a conflict with) asserted rights of others with respect to any of the foregoing that, if such assertion of infringement or conflict were sustained, could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The use of the Intellectual Property in connection with the business and operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any person, except for such infringement as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (z) The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have filed all federal, state, local or foreign income and franchise tax returns required to be filed and all such returns are true, complete and correct in all material respects. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have paid all taxes shown thereon as due, and there is no material tax deficiency which has been or is reasonably likely to be asserted against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries; all material tax liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries are adequately provided for on the books of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

          (aa) The Company, either directly or through one or more Subsidiaries, has in effect, with financially sound insurers, insurance with respect to its business and properties and the business and properties of the Subsidiaries against loss or damage of the kind customarily insured against by corporations engaged in the same or similar businesses and similarly situated, of such type and in such amounts as are customarily carried under similar circumstances by such other corporations; neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (A) has received notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that substantial capital improvements or other material expenditures will have to be made in order to continue such insurance or (B) has any reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such

16





 





coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers at a cost that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

          (bb) The Company and the Subsidiaries are in compliance with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (“ERISA”), except where the failure to be in such compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; no “reportable event” (as defined in ERISA and with respect to which the 30-day notice provision has not been waived) has occurred with respect to any “pension plan” (as defined in ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA for which the Company or any Subsidiary would have liability; except for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur liability under (A) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any “pension plan” or (B) Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published interpretations thereunder (“Code”); and each “pension plan” for which the Company and the Subsidiaries would have any liability that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act, which would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

          (cc) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the sale of the Securities will not involve any nonexempt prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406(a) of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1)(A) of the Code.

          (dd) The Company is subject to and in compliance in all material respects with the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (ee) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an “investment company” that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act; and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be, an “investment company” or a company “controlled” by an “investment company” incorporated in the United States within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

          (ff) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that: (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or specific authorizations; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for its assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

          (gg) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating

17





 





to the Company and the Subsidiaries is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company by others within the Company or any Subsidiary, and such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective to perform the functions for which they were established subject to the limitations of any such control system. The Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company have been advised of: (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and since the date of the most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. As of September 30, 2009, the Company and the Subsidiaries’ internal controls over financial reporting were reasonably effective to perform the functions for which they were established, subject to the limitations of any such control system, and the Company and the Subsidiaries are not aware of any material weakness in their internal control over financial reporting.

          (hh) None of the Company or any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 501(b) of Regulation D under the Act) has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to, cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

          (ii) The Company has not made any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a “free writing prospectus” (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 under the Act (other than those listed on Schedule V hereto) without the prior consent of the Underwriters.

          (jj) No forward-looking statement (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act) contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package has been made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or has been disclosed other than in good faith.

          (kk) As of September 30, 2009, none of the Company or any Subsidiary had any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that were not set forth in the consolidated balance sheet as of such date or in the notes thereto set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus. Since September 30, 2009, except as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, (a) none of the Company or any Subsidiary has (1) incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (2) entered into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, or (3) purchased any of its outstanding capital stock, (b) there has not been any material adverse change, prospective change, event or development in respect of the business, properties, prospects, results of operations or condition (financial or other) of the Company and the Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) there has been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the

18





 





Company on any class of capital stock and (d) there has not been any material change in the capital stock, short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

          (ll) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (nor any agent thereof acting on their behalf) has taken, and none of them will take, any action that might cause this Agreement or the issuance or sale of the Notes to violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as in effect, or as the same may hereafter be in effect, on the Closing Date.

          (mm) Deloitte & Touche LLP is an independent accountant within the meaning of the Act. The historical financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries at the respective dates and for the respective periods indicated. Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented (except as disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus). The other financial and statistical information and data included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus are accurately presented in all material respects and prepared on a basis consistent with the financial statements and the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

          (nn) The Company is not and, upon consummation of the transactions, will not be (A) “insolvent” as that term is defined in Section 101(32) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) (11 U.S.C. § 101(32)), Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”) or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (“UFCA”), (B) an entity with “unreasonably small capital” as that term is used in Section 548(a)(2)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code or Section 5 of the UFCA, (C) engaged or about to engage in a business or transaction for which its remaining property is “unreasonably small” in relation to the business or transaction as that term is used in Section 4 of the UFTA or (D) unable to pay its debts as they mature or become due, within the meaning of Section 548(a)(2)(B)(iii) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 4 of the UFTA and Section 6 of the UFCA. The Company now owns and upon consummation of the transactions will own assets having a value of both “fair valuation” and at “present fair saleable value” greater than the amount required to pay its “debts” as such terms are used in Section 2 of the UFTA and Section 2 of the UFCA.

          (oo) Except as described in the section entitled “Underwriting” in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other person other than the Underwriters that would give rise to a valid claim against, the Company, any Subsidiary or the Underwriters for a brokerage commission, finder’s fee or like payment in connection with the issuance, purchase and sale of the Securities.

          (pp) The Indenture is in sufficient form for due qualification under the Trust Indenture Act.

          (qq) The industry, statistical and market-related data included in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus are based on or derived from sources that the Company

19





 





reasonably and in good faith believe to be reliable and accurate in all material respects and represent their good faith estimates that are made on the basis of data derived from such sources.

          (rr) There is and has been no failure on the part of the Company and any of the Company’s directors or officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with any provision of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith, including without limitation Section 402 related to loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to certifications, other than any such failures which would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          Each certificate or document signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Underwriters or counsel for the Underwriters pursuant to, or in connection with, this Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Company to the Underwriters as to the matters covered by such certificate or document. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters and, for purposes of the opinions to be delivered to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement, counsel to the Company and counsel to the Underwriters will rely upon the accuracy and truth of the foregoing representations and the Company hereby consent to such reliance.

          6. Indemnification.

          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriters, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, the agents, employees, affiliates, officers and directors of any Underwriter and the agents, employees, affiliates, officers and directors of any such controlling person from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses whatsoever (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and any and all reasonable expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever, and any and all reasonable amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation) (collectively, “Losses”) to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the Pricing Term Sheet), the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the Pricing Term Sheet), the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission relating to an Underwriter made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information relating to an Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have, including, but not limited to, liability under this Agreement.

20





 





          (b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and each of their respective agents, employees, officers and directors and the agents, employees, officers and directors of any such controlling person from and against any Losses to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, , the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the Pricing Term Sheet), the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission relating to such Underwriter made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein. The Company and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, acknowledge that the information set forth in Section 9 is the only information furnished in writing by the Underwriters to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Pricing Disclosure Package (including the Pricing Term Sheet), the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.

          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection 6(a) or 6(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding (collectively, an “action”), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify each party against whom indemnification is to be sought in writing of the commencement of such action (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in such action, and to the extent it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such action, but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party or parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the indemnifying parties in connection with the defense of such action, (ii) the indemnifying parties shall not have employed counsel to take charge of the defense of such action within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, (iii) the named parties to such action (including any impleaded parties) include such indemnified party and the indemnifying parties (or such indemnifying parties have assumed the defense of such action), and such indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available to it or them that are different from or additional

21





 





to those available to one or all of the indemnifying parties (in which case the indemnifying parties shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or parties), or (iv) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be borne by the indemnifying parties. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its written consent which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6, then the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 45 days prior notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

          7. Contribution.

          (a) In order to provide for contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 6 of this Agreement is for any reason held to be unavailable from the indemnifying party, or is insufficient to hold harmless a party indemnified under Section 6 of this Agreement, each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such aggregate Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (x) the total proceeds from the offering of the Securities (net of discounts and commissions but before deducting expenses) received by the Company are to (y) the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters as set forth in this Agreement. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the

22





 





Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omission.

          (b) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) in no case shall any Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount and commissions applicable to the Securities pursuant to this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Underwriters shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution the Company. Any party entitled to contribution will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party or parties under this Section 7, notify such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party or parties shall not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it or they may have under this Section 7 or otherwise, except to the extent that it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 6 for purposes of indemnification. Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, no party shall be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent, provided, however, that such written consent was not unreasonably withheld. The obligations of the Underwriters to make any contributions pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall be several and not joint.

          8. Conditions of Underwriters’ Obligations. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities, as the case may be, as provided for in this Agreement, shall be subject to satisfaction of the following conditions prior to or concurrently with such purchase:

          (a) All of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and made pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be true and correct, or true and correct in all material respects where such representations and warranties are not qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, on the date of this Agreement and, in each case after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, on the Closing Date (and if settlement of the Option Securities occurs after the Closing Date, on such settlement date), except that if a representation and warranty is made as of a specific date, and such date is expressly referred to therein, such representation and warranty shall be true and correct (or true and correct in all material respects, as applicable) as of such date.

          (b) The Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b)under the Act and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Representatives and shall have been printed and copies distributed to the Underwriters on the date of this Agreement or at such later date as the Underwriters may determine. Any material required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act has been filed within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433 under the Act. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use or suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Securities in any jurisdiction shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been commenced or shall be pending or threatened.

          (c) No action shall have been taken and no statute, rule, regulation or order shall have been enacted, adopted or issued by any governmental agency, body, or official that would, as of the Closing Date, prevent the issuance of the Securities; and, except as disclosed in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, no action, suit or proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending against or affecting or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and no stop order preventing the use of the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, shall have been issued. The Company shall not have amended or supplemented the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus) or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Underwriters shall previously have been advised of such proposed amendment or supplement at least two business days prior to the proposed use, and shall not have reasonably objected to such amendment or supplement.

          (d) As of September 30, 2009, except as set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have had any material liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that were not set forth in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of such date or in the notes thereto set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus. Since September 30, 2009, except as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus, (a) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has (1) incurred any liabilities or obligations, direct or contingent, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (2) entered into any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, or (3) purchased any of its outstanding capital stock, (b) there shall not have been any material adverse change, prospective change, event or development in respect of the business, properties, prospects, results of operations or condition (financial or other) of the Company or its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (c) there shall have been no dividend or distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company on any class of capital stock and (d) there shall not have been any material change in the capital stock, short-term debt or long-term debt of the Company or of any of the Subsidiaries,

The agreements contained in Sections 4(g), 6, 7, 9 and 11(d) shall survive the termination of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section 11.

          11. Effective Date of Agreement; Termination.

          (a) This Agreement shall become effective upon execution and delivery of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties hereto.

          (b) The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing Date by notice to the Company from the Underwriters, without liability (other than with respect to Sections 6 and 7) on the Underwriters’ part to the Company if, on or prior to such date, (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable to perform in any material respect any agreement on its part to be performed under this Agreement when and as required, (ii) any other condition to the obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement to be fulfilled by the Company pursuant to Section 8 is not fulfilled when and as required and not waived in writing by the Underwriters, (iii) trading in the Company’s securities on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market shall have been suspended, (iv) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select or NASDAQ Global Market shall have been suspended or materially limited, or minimum prices shall have been established thereon by the Commission, or by such exchange or other regulatory body or governmental authority having jurisdiction, (v) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by federal or New York authorities, (vi) there is an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity, in any case involving the United States, on or after the date of this Agreement, or if there has been a declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other national or international calamity or crisis (economic, political, financial or otherwise) which affects the U.S. and international markets, making it, in the Representatives’ judgment, impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus or (vii) there shall have been such a material adverse change or material disruption in the financial, banking or capital markets generally (including, without limitation, the markets for debt securities of companies similar to the Company) or the effect (or potential effect if the financial markets in the United States have not yet opened) of international conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such as, in the Representatives’ judgment, to make it inadvisable or impracticable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus.

          (c) Any notice of termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be given at the address specified in Section 12 below by telephone, telex, telephonic facsimile or telegraph, confirmed in writing by letter.

27





 





          (d) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 11(b), or if the sale of the Notes provided for in this Agreement is not consummated because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in this Agreement to be satisfied on its part or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement in this Agreement or comply with any provision of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of the Underwriters’ counsel) incurred in connection with this Agreement.

          (e) If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Underwritten Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the principal amount of Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Underwritten Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Underwritten Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11(f), the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven Business Days, as the Underwriters shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
