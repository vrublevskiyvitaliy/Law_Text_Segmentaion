6. TIME SCHEDULE AND DEADLINES

All schedules and time are related on the project start. The project start is defined as the moment, when the down payment has been done by DAQO.

1 - Documentation of Know How and knowledge transfer

All documentation of the Know How described in Section 3 above will be delivered by the Contractor to the Customer within 4 (four) months after project start.

Note: The supply of the documentation will take place progressively in coordination with the preparation of the documentation of the Basic Engineering Package (as set forth in Section 4 and 5 above) as the availability of several elements of the basic engineering is necessary for the preparation of the documentation of the Know How. However, this process of preparation of the documentation will in no event extend the time period set forth above.
