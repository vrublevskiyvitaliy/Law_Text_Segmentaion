1.2.2 The Committee shall have the power and authority to select Award Recipients and grant Awards to such Award Recipients. The Committee may make such rules and regulations and establish such procedures for the administration of this Outperformance Program as it deems appropriate.

1.2.3 The Committee may, in its absolute discretion, without amendment to this Outperformance Program, accelerate the lapse of restrictions, or waive any condition imposed hereunder, with respect to any Award, or otherwise adjust any of the terms applicable to any such Award; provided, however, that no action under this Section 1.2.3 shall adversely affect any outstanding Awards without the consent of the holder thereof.

1.2.4 All decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Outperformance Program shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and the Award Recipients.

ARTICLE 2

OUTPERFORMANCE AWARDS

2.1 Awards for Performance Periods. On or prior to the Valuation Date for a Performance Period, the Committee, in its discretion, shall (i) determine the Effective Date and Measurement Date for such Performance Period, (ii) select those Eligible Persons who shall be Award Recipients for such Performance Period, (iii) determine the amount of each Award Recipient’s Award for such Performance Period, which will consist of a Participation Percentage (and, in some circumstances, an Unallocated Participation Percentage) for such Performance Period, (iv) determine the Maximum Absolute Outperformance Pool Amount and how to calculate the Absolute Outperformance Pool Amount for such Performance Period and (v) determine the Maximum Relative Outperformance Pool Amount and how to calculate the Relative Outperformance Pool Amount for such Performance Period. Promptly after the Committee selects an Award Recipient to receive an Award for a Performance Period, the Company will provide the Award Recipient with a participation letter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each, a “Participation Letter”) notifying the Award Recipient of his or her Award. The Committee shall have the right to increase an Award Recipient’s Participation Percentage for a Performance Period

 

7



from time to time and at any time prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, in which case a new Participation Letter will be provided to the Award Recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total Participation Percentages of all Award Recipients for a Performance Period under this Outperformance Program may not exceed 100%.

2.2 Determination of Absolute Outperformance Pool and Relative Outperformance Pool. As soon as practicable following the Valuation Date for a Performance Period, but as of the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, the Committee will calculate the size of the Absolute Outperformance Pool and the Relative Outperformance Pool for such Performance Period, if any. If the performance of the Company has been such that each of the Absolute Outperformance Pool and the Relative Outperformance Pool for a Performance Period is zero, then the Award Recipients will not be entitled to be paid any amounts under this Program for such Performance Period and the Awards will be terminated as of the Valuation Date for such Performance Period. If the Absolute Outperformance Pool and/or the Relative Outperformance Pool for a Performance Period, as of the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, is greater than zero, then the Award Recipients will be entitled to the payments described in Section 2.3 below.

2.3 Award Payments for Performance Periods.

2.3.1 With respect to a Performance Period, in the event that the Absolute Outperformance Pool and/or the Relative Outperformance Pool for such Performance Period, as of the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, is greater than zero, then the Committee will perform the following calculations with respect to each Award: multiply (x) the sum of (i) the Absolute Outperformance Pool for such Performance Period plus (ii) the Relative Outperformance Pool for such Performance Period, in each case calculated as of the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, by (y) the Final Participation Percentage for such Award Recipient for such Performance Period, then divide the result by (z) the Common Stock Price on the Valuation Date for such Performance Period; the resulting number is hereafter referred to as the “Award Shares.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Valuation Date for such Performance Period is not the Measurement Date for such Performance Period (i.e., the Valuation Date is the date upon which a Change in Control occurred during such Performance Period), then the Award Shares shall be the larger of (i) the Award Shares calculated pursuant to the preceding sentence multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from and including the first day of such Performance Period to and including the date upon which a Change in Control occurred during such Performance Period and the denominator of which is the number of days from and including the first day of such Performance Period to and including the Measurement Date for such Performance Period and (ii) the Award Shares that would have been earned pursuant to the preceding sentence if the Absolute Total Shareholder Return had been calculated based on the aggregate total return actually achieved during such Performance Period, but, for purposes of determining the average, annual, compound return, assumed that such return had been generated over the full period from the Effective Date of such Performance Period to the Measurement Date for such Performance Period.

2.3.2 Subject to the terms hereof, the Award Shares shall be issued as of the Valuation Date for a Performance Period, notwithstanding that, as an administrative matter, certificates or other evidence representing the Award Shares may be issued subsequent to any such date.

2.4 Termination and Forfeiture; Vesting; Change in Control.

2.4.1 With respect to a Performance Period, if at any time prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period an Award Recipient’s employment by the Company shall terminate or cease by reason of a Qualified Termination, then, with respect to the Award Recipient only, (i) such Award Recipient’s Unallocated Participation Percentage shall be forfeited in full effective as of the date of the

 

8



Qualified Termination, (ii) after giving effect to such forfeiture, the calculations provided in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof shall be performed with respect to such Award Recipient’s Award effective as of the date of the Qualified Termination as if a Change in Control had occurred (with respect to the Award Recipient only) on such date, (ii) such Award Recipient shall be issued the Award Shares resulting from such calculation, and (iii) the Award Shares resulting from such calculation shall automatically and immediately vest as of the date of the Qualified Termination.

2.4.2 With respect to a Performance Period, if at any time prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period an Award Recipient’s employment by the Company shall terminate or cease for any reason other than a Qualified Termination, then such Award Recipient’s Award for such Performance Period shall be forfeited at such time. With respect to a Performance Period, if at any time on or after the Valuation Date for such Performance Period an Award Recipient’s employment by the Company shall terminate or cease for any reason other than a Qualified Termination, then all of such Award Recipient’s Award Shares for such Performance Period that remain unvested at such time shall automatically and immediately be forfeited by such Award Recipient.

2.4.3 In the event that the Committee grants a new Award for a Performance Period that would cause the aggregate Participation Percentages and Unallocated Participation Percentages of all of the Awards granted by the Committee for such Performance Period, without giving effect to any forfeitures or re-grants of forfeited Awards, to exceed 100%, then each prior Award Recipient shall automatically forfeit an amount of such Award Recipient’s Unallocated Participation Percentage equal to (i) the Participation Percentage and initial Unallocated Participation Percentage of such new Award multiplied by (ii) such Award Recipient’s Pro Rata Share. For purposes of this Section, an Award Recipient’s “Pro Rata Share” for a Performance Period shall mean (i) such Award Recipient’s Unallocated Participation Percentage for such Performance Period divided by (ii) 100% less the aggregate Participation Percentages of all Awards granted by the Committee for such Performance Period, without giving effect to any forfeitures or re-grants of forfeited Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total Participation Percentages of all Award Recipients for a Performance Period under this Outperformance Program may not exceed 100% and, after giving effect to the forfeitures provided for in this Section 2.4.3, the total Participation Percentages and Unallocated Participation Percentages of all Award Recipients for a Performance Period under this Outperformance Program may not exceed 100%. In the event that an Award Recipient forfeits a portion of such Award Recipient’s Unallocated Participation Percentage for a Performance Period under this Section 2.4.3, the Committee shall reasonably promptly notify such Award Recipient of such forfeiture; provided that such forfeiture shall occur automatically regardless of whether such notice is given.

2.4.4 With respect to a Performance Period, subject to Section 2.4.2 hereof, the Award Shares shall become vested as follows: (i) fifty percent (50%) of such Award Shares shall become vested on the Measurement Date for such Performance Period; and (ii) the remaining fifty percent (50%) of such Award Shares shall become vested on the first (1st) anniversary of the Measurement Date for such Performance Period; provided, however, that all unvested Award Shares that have not previously been forfeited shall vest immediately upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or a Qualified Termination. For the avoidance of doubt, the vesting of the Award Shares pursuant to this Section 2.4.4 shall be independent from, and in no way effect, the calculations set forth in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 hereof.

2.4.5 With respect to a Performance Period, prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period, the Committee may allocate part or all of any Award or any unvested portion thereof which has been forfeited pursuant to Section 2.4.2 to one or more of the other Award Recipients then existing or to one or more new Award Recipients, including newly hired employees. Any Unallocated Participation Percentages with respect to a Performance Period that are forfeited prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period will be automatically re-allocated, as of the date of such forfeiture, to

 

9



the remaining Award Recipients for such Performance Period proportionally based on the relative amounts of such Award Recipients’ Unallocated Participation Percentages for such Performance Period prior to such forfeiture; provided that the Committee, in its sole discretion, may at any time on or prior to the Valuation Date for such Performance Period reverse some or all of such automatic re-allocations and either specifically re-allocate some or all of such forfeited Unallocated Participation Percentages to specific Award Recipients or choose not to re-allocate some or all of such forfeited Unallocated Participation Percentages (and retain them for the Company’s benefit). The Committee shall notify each Award Recipient whose Unallocated Participation Percentage is increased or decreased as a result of the operation of this Section 2.4.5 reasonably promptly after such increase or decrease.

2.5 Issuance of Other Securities in lieu of Common Stock. In lieu of shares of Common Stock, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit some or all of the Award Recipients to receive their Award Shares in LTIP Units or other securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise calculated by reference to or based on, shares of Common Stock (“Other Share-Based Securities”); provided, that the Committee determines, in good faith, that the aggregate value of such Other Share-Based Securities is equivalent to the value of the Award Shares to be issued to such Award Recipient(s) pursuant to Section 2.3.1. Other Share-Based Securities may be issued in lieu of all the Award Shares of such Award Recipient(s) or a portion thereof. The Committee shall determine the restrictions and conditions, under this Program or otherwise, applicable to such Other Share-Based Securities.

2.6 Dividends. From and after their issuance, Award Shares shall be entitled to the same dividend on a per share basis as all other shares of Common Stock without regard to whether such Award Share has then vested (which dividend shall be non-refundable, notwithstanding any subsequent forfeiture, if any, of Award Shares in respect of which such dividend was paid).

2.7 Restrictions on Transfer. Except as otherwise permitted by the Committee, no Award Recipient shall sell, assign, transfer, pledge, give away or in any other manner disposed of, whether voluntarily or by operation of law (each such action a “Transfer”) any Award or any Award Share prior to the date on which it vests; provided that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the lapse of such restrictions in installments and may accelerate or waive such restrictions in whole or in part based on such factors and such circumstances as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion.

2.8 Rights with Respect to Award. Without duplication with the provisions of Section 14 of the Plan, if (i) the Company shall at any time be involved in a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, reorganization, exchange of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company or a transaction similar thereto, (ii) any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, stock combination, reclassification, recapitalization, significant repurchase of shares, or other similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or any distribution to holders of Common Stock other than ordinary cash dividends, shall occur or (iii) any other event shall occur which in the judgment of the Committee necessitates action by way of adjusting the terms of this Outperformance Program, then and in that event, the Committee shall take such action as shall be necessary to maintain the Award Recipients’ rights hereunder so that they are substantially proportionate to the rights existing under this Outperformance Program prior to such event. After the issuance of the Award Shares, the Award Recipient shall possess all incidents of ownership with respect to each Award Share which is outstanding, including voting rights, without regard to whether such Award Share has then vested, except as otherwise set forth herein.

In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between this Outperformance Program and the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall control.

Each such certificate or book entry shall be registered in the name of the appropriate Award Recipient. The certificates or any written statement evidencing the book entry of the Award Shares issued hereunder shall bear a legend referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to such Award Shares hereunder, substantially in the following form (in addition to any other legend the Committee may determine to be necessary or appropriate) and, if shares are not certificated, such legend(s) shall also be entered in the Company’s book entry electronic records:

11



Award Shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions (including those relating to vesting and transferability) set forth in this Outperformance Program shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition to the issuance of the Award Shares to any Award Recipient such Award Recipient shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to such Award Shares. If and when such restrictions lapse, the stock certificates, if any, shall be delivered by the Company to the appropriate Award Recipient or his designee.

3.4 Withholding of Tax. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments required to be made by the Company hereunder shall be subject to the withholding of such amounts as the Company reasonably may determine that it is required to withhold pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law or regulation; provided that, to the extent Awards under this Program are made in shares of Common Stock, the Company will satisfy the required minimum tax withholding obligation with respect to such Awards by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to such minimum tax withholding obligation. The Company’s obligation to deliver stock certificates (or evidence of book entry) to any Award Recipient is subject to and conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by such Award Recipient.

Re:

Participation in the DCT Industrial Trust Inc. Multi-Year Outperformance Program

Dear [Name]:

You are hereby granted an Award by DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (the “Company”) under the DCT Industrial Trust Inc. Multi-Year Outperformance Program (the “Program”) with the following terms, in addition to those specified in the Program:

Effective Date: December 31, 20    .

Measurement Date: December 31, 20    .

Maximum Absolute Outperformance Pool Amount: $        .

Maximum Relative Outperformance Pool Amount: $        .

Participation Percentage:     %

Initial Unallocated Participation Percentage:     %

Pursuant to the Program, the Performance Period for your Award will begin on the Effective Date set forth above and end on the Measurement Date set forth above, unless a Change in Control occurs prior to the Measurement Date. Generally, under the Program, (a) in the event that the Company’s average, compounded, annual return to stockholders during the Performance Period is equal to or greater than 8%, then an absolute outperformance pool will be formed under the Program in accordance with the absolute outperformance table set forth below and subject to a maximum equal to the Maximum Absolute Outperformance Pool Amount, and/or (b) in the event that the Company’s average, compounded, annual return to shareholders during the Performance Period is equal to or greater than 100% of the total return of the MSCI US REIT Index (RMS) during the Performance Period, then a relative outperformance pool will be formed under the Program in accordance with the relative outperformance table set forth below and subject to a maximum equal to the Maximum Relative Outperformance Pool Amount. Your award, generally, will equal your Participation Percentage (plus any portion of your initial Unallocated Participation Percentage that is not allocated to another award recipient and thereby forfeited) multiplied by the total absolute outperformance pool and relative outperformance pool formed based on the Company’s performance. Your award will be paid in the form of restricted shares of common stock of the Company, which will vest 50% on the date of issuance and the remaining 50% on the first (1st) anniversary of the end of the Performance Period, subject to continued employment. The Company may offer you the choice to receive LTIP units in the Company’s operating partnership, DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP, in lieu of shares of restricted stock. Special provisions will apply, and you may forfeit some or all of your award, in the event that your employment is terminated or a change in control of the Company occurs prior to the end of the Performance Period. Your initial Unallocated Participation Percentage may be increased or decreased by subsequent events, such as the grant of



additional awards by the Company or the forfeiture of awards by other award recipients. The Company expects to notify you if and when your initial Unallocated Participation Percentage changes, but it may change without notice.
