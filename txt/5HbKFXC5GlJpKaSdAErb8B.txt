(b)       Reduced as a result of casualty or condemnation loss by the amount determined under Section 3.2;

 

(c)       Reduced or increased by the amount of any positive or negative imbalance of as set forth on Schedule 4.14 based on a price determined based on the applicable basis differential offered to Sellers off the current prompt month futures price for natural gas as reported on the NYMEX for the next month succeeding the Closing;

 



 

7

(e)       Increased by the amount of capital expenditures incurred after December 11, 2009, up to the Effective Time in connection with fracturing operations on the O’Meara-Webb 687 Unit 1-H Well, Dimmit County, Texas, to the extent required to maintain Sellers’ contractual rights under the Joint Exploration Agreement dated September 28, 2007, by and between EnCana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. and TXCO Energy Corp. to the extent Sellers are unable to negotiate an extension for such operation with EnCana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. after the Effective Time; and

(a)       Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall prepare and send (i) notices to those third parties from whom any required consents to assignment requesting consents to the Conveyances must be obtained, and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential rights to purchase or similar rights in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9.  The consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset.  Upon notice to Sellers from a holder of any preferential rights to purchase that such holder desires to exercise such preferential rights to purchase, Purchasers shall within five (5) business days provide to Sellers the Allocated Value for the Assets subject to such preferential rights.  Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Sellers shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents and waivers.  Alternatively, Sellers may seek an order of the Bankruptcy Court to permit the Conveyances over the objections of third parties.  Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment, waivers of preferential rights, or orders of the Bankruptcy Court.

 

(b)       If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to Closing, then, for the purposes of this Agreement, such Assets shall not be included in the transaction at Closing as Assets purchased by Purchasers and Sellers shall either (i) pay Purchasers at Closing the Allocated Value for such Assets paid by such holder or (ii) reduce the Purchase Price due Sellers at Closing by the amount of the Allocated Value for such Assets.

Section 3.2      Casualty and Condemnation Loss.  If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Purchasers shall nevertheless be required to close and Purchasers shall elect by written notice to Sellers prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers’ sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) to accept an assignment of Sellers’ insurance proceeds and other claims against third parties with respect to the casualty or taking.  Notwithstanding the preceding, (i) if the aggregate losses caused by such casualties and takings exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, any Seller or Purchasers may, by notice to the other at least one Business Day prior to Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1 or (ii) if the losses caused by such casualties and takings exceed ten percent (10%) of the Allocated Value of any Lease, Purchasers may by notice to Sellers at least one Business Day prior to Closing elect to accept an assignment of Sellers’ insurance proceeds and other claims against third parties with respect to such casualty and takings

Section 7.5         Operation of Business.

 

(a)         Until the Closing, each Seller (i) will continue to conduct its business related to the Assets in the ordinary course consistent with its past practices, including incurring expenditures associated with lease acquisitions, renewals and extensions, landmen, independent contractors, vendors, title opinions, curative material, road, drillsite and pipeline construction, acquisition of road and pipeline right-of-ways, drilling, and completing wells, construction of gathering, compression and treating facilities, and marketing costs, (ii) will furnish Purchasers with copies of all third-party and any Seller-generated drilling, completion and workover AFEs in excess of $100,000 within five (5) Business Days of receipt of third-party AFEs or the approval of any Seller generated AFE, (iii) will furnish Purchasers, on the 15th day of each month, with a schedule setting forth the actual expenditures incurred during the previous calendar month and an estimate of the expenditures that Sellers believes that it will incur during the following reporting period, (iv) will not after the Effective Time, without prior written approval of Purchasers (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), make capital or workover expenditures with respect to the Assets in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (net to the respective Seller’s interest), except for those capital expenditures set forth on Exhibit A-8 and Schedule 4.17 or when required by an emergency when there shall have been insufficient time to obtain advance consent (provider, that such Seller will promptly notify Purchasers of any such emergency expenditures), (v) will not enter into any Material Contract relating to the Assets except for agreements relating to sales of inventory and purchases of inventory from suppliers in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, (vi) will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets presently furnished by nonaffiliated third parties in the amounts and of the types presently in force, (vii) subject to the terms and conditions imposed by its lenders and other contractual obligations, will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all Leases and Lands that are presently producing in paying quantities, (viii) will maintain all material governmental permits and approvals affecting the Assets, (ix) will not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material Properties or Equipment except for sales and dispositions of Equipment made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices absent Bankruptcy Court approval on notice and with a reasonable opportunity to object by Purchasers, or (x) take or omit to take any action in contravention of any of the foregoing actions.  Purchasers’ approval of any action restricted by this Section 7.5 shall be considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is properly specified in the notice provided to Sellers by a co-working interest owner) of the Sellers’ notice to Purchasers requesting such consent unless Purchasers notify Sellers to the contrary during that period.  In the event of an emergency, Sellers may take such action as a prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchasers of such action promptly thereafter.

(b)         Prior to the Closing, Sellers will give Purchasers notice of all AFEs proposed either by Sellers or any third party (each a “Proposed AFE”).  If Sellers elect not to pay or otherwise timely satisfy a Proposed AFE, Purchasers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to fund the Proposed AFE.  In such event, the parties agree to seek an emergency hearing with the Bankruptcy Court authorizing Purchasers to advance the amount of the Proposed AFE as an administrative expense (an “AFE Advance”).  If the Closing does not occur and this Agreement is terminated, the Purchaser making an AFE Advance shall be reimbursed the amount of such AFE Advance on the effective date of a plan of reorganization for Sellers in the Bankruptcy Court.  If the Closing occurs, (x) there will be no adjustment to the Purchase Price by reason of either (i) any AFE Advance(s) or any amounts funded by such AFE Advance in respect of such Proposed AFE(s) or (ii) any other damages or amounts in respect of any proposed Proposed AFE that Sellers shall have elected not to pay or otherwise satisfy and that Purchasers shall not have funded in accordance with this paragraph (b), (y) Sellers shall have no obligations to repay to Purchasers, or otherwise in respect of, any AFE Advance made in respect of a Proposed AFE due at any time after the Effective Time, and (z) if any AFE Advance has been made in respect of a Proposed AFE due at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the lesser of (i) the amount of such AFE Advance or (ii) the Allocated Value of any undeveloped, non-producing acreage that would have been lost or forfeited if the subject Proposed AFE was not timely paid.

 

(c)         Pursuant to Agreed Order Granting Motion to Approve Lease Participation Proposal with St. Mary Land & Exploration Company and Agreement with Newfield Exploration Company for Purchase of Leasehold Interests Acquired Pursuant to Participation Under Anadarko JEA, Sellers have the right to make certain elections with respect to the St. Mary Proposal (as defined in such order).  Sellers hereby beneficially assign to Purchasers Sellers’ rights under the order to make such elections and to receive any reimbursements for the Election Amount (as defined in the order).  Sellers shall promptly communicate any notices required under the order to be delivered to St. Mary as may be directed by Purchasers.

Section 7.8         Solicitation Provisions.  Following the date hereof, Sellers agree that neither they nor any of their wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall, and that they shall direct any of their directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively “Representatives”) and their wholly-owned Subsidiaries’ Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit any Acquisition Proposal or engage or discuss with any Person who has made an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (including providing access to the Seller Data Room and access to other non-public information for due diligence purposes to any Person).

 

Section 7.9         Tax Matters.  Subject to the provisions of Section 12.5, Sellers shall be responsible for all Taxes (other than ad valorem, property, severance, production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, which are addressed in Section 1.4) attributable to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, including income Taxes arising as a result of the gain recognized on the transfer of the Assets, and Purchasers shall be responsible for all such Taxes attributable to any period of time after the Effective Time.  Regardless of which Party is responsible, Sellers shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to Closing (and shall file all returns with respect to such Taxes).

Section 7.14       Schedule Updates.  Sellers or Purchasers may, from time to time prior to the Closing, by written notice to the other Parties, supplement or amend any Schedule delivered by Sellers or Purchasers hereunder.  For purposes of determining whether Purchaser’s conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) have been fulfilled, Sellers’ Schedules shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any supplement or amendment thereto, but if the Closing shall occur, then any matters disclosed to Purchasers pursuant to any such supplement or amendment after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing shall be deemed incorporated into such Schedules for purposes of Article 11.

Section 11.2        Indemnification Actions.  All claims for indemnification under Section 11.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a)          For purposes of this Article 11, the term “Indemnifying Person” when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11, and the term “Indemnified Person” when used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another Person or Persons pursuant to this Article 11.

 

(b)          To make claim for indemnification under Section 11.1, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this Section 11.2, including the specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the “Claim Notice”).  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Person (a “Claim”), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.2 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section 11.1 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Person's ability to defend against the Claim.  In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which was inaccurate or breached.

(c)          If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.  The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof.  If requested by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person).  The Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 11.2(d).  An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(d)          If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof.  If the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to a Claim, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for 10 days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement.  If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed the defense of the Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity therefor.

 

Section 11.3        Limitation on Actions.  Notwithstanding the remaining provisions hereof, the provisions of this Article 11 are subject to the following:

 

(a)          The representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto, as well as the covenants and agreements set forth herein or therein that are contemplated to be performed prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing (unless a shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable section).  The covenants and agreements set forth herein or therein that are contemplated to be performed after the Closing, shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein or therein.  Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 

(b)          The indemnities in Sections 11.1(a)(i)(2), 11.1(a)(i)(3), 11.1(a)(ii)(2), 11.1(a)(iii)(3) and 11.1(b) shall terminate as of the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing, except in each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date.  The indemnities in Sections 11.1(a)(i)(1) and 11.1(a)(ii)(1) shall continue without time limit.

(d)          The maximum aggregate amount for which Sellers may be liable for indemnification under Section 11.1 shall be limited to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000).

 

(e)          The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates).

 

(f)           In no event shall the Purchasers have any obligation hereunder to indemnify any Seller who does not actually convey any portion of the Assets to Purchasers under this Agreement or otherwise have any direct or indirect interest in any portion of the Assets.  Likewise, no Seller who does not actually convey any portion of the Assets to Purchasers under this Agreement or otherwise have any direct or indirect interest in any portion of the Assets shall have any obligation hereunder to indemnify the Purchasers.  Upon the request of any Party hereto, the Parties agree to enter into any amendment to this Agreement reasonably necessary to remove any Seller who does not actually convey any portion of the Assets to Purchasers under this Agreement or otherwise have any direct or indirect interest in any portion of the Assets as a Party to this Agreement.
