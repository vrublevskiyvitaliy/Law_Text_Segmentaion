     (iv) The Issuer has been duly formed as a limited liability company and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability company in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and has the requisite power and authority to own or hold its properties and to conduct the business in which it is engaged as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Circular;

     (v) The Issuer has the requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Securities, the Indenture and any other Transaction Document to which it is a party and perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder;

     (vi) Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Issuer is a party has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors’ rights or by general equitable principles;

     (vii) The Issuer is not in violation of the LLC Agreement or in default in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement or lease to which it is a party or by

3





 





which it or its properties may be bound. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which the Issuer is a party and the incurrence of the obligations and consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with, or constitute a breach of or default under, the LLC Agreement or any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement or lease, to which the Issuer is a party or by which it or its properties may be bound, or any law, administrative regulation or court decree;

     (viii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer;

     (ix) The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance, offer and sale as contemplated by this Agreement and, when authenticated by the Indenture Trustee and issued and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar laws relating to or affecting generally the enforcement of creditors’ rights or by general equitable principles;

     (x) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body is required for the issuance, offer or sale of the Securities by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents except to the extent provided for in the Transaction Documents;

It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any one time for all such indemnified party or parties. Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity agreements contained in Sections 9(a) and 9(b), shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such action or claim. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or claim, the indemnifying party agrees to

22





 





indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

          The obligations of the Issuer, PHH, VMS and the Initial Purchasers in this Section 9 and in Section 10 are in addition to any other liability that the Issuer, PHH, VMS or the Initial Purchasers, as the case may be, may otherwise have, including in respect of any breaches of representations, warranties and agreements made herein by any such party.

          10. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or 9(b), then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuer, PHH and VMS on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuer, PHH and VMS on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuer, PHH and VMS on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by or on behalf of the Issuer on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, on the other, bear to the total gross proceeds from the sale of the Securities under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to the Issuer, PHH or VMS or information supplied by the Issuer, PHH or VMS on the one hand or to any Initial Purchasers’ Information on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Issuer, VMS, PHH and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 10, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, no Initial

23





 





Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the Securities purchased by it under this Agreement exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers’ obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 10 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.

          11. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer, VMS, PHH and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except as provided in Sections 9 and 10 with respect to affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and controlling persons of the Issuer, PHH, VMS and the Initial Purchasers and in Section 4(e) with respect to holders and prospective purchasers of the Securities. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 11, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.

          12. Expenses. The Issuer agrees with the Initial Purchasers to pay (a) all costs, expenses, fees and taxes incident to and in connection with the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities; (b) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and distribution of the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Final Offering Circular and any amendments or supplements thereto; (c) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (d) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and delivery of the certificates evidencing the Securities, including stamp duties and transfer taxes, if any, payable upon issuance of the Securities; (e) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Issuer, PHH, PHH Sub 1, PHH Sub 2, Holdings, the Origination Trust, VMS and independent accountants; (f) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Initial Purchasers; (g) the fees and expenses of qualifying the Securities under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions and of preparing, printing and distributing Blue Sky Memoranda (including related fees and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers); (h) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (i) the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee and any paying agent (including reasonable related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (j) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with the approval of the Securities for book-entry transfer by DTC; (k) the fees and expenses incurred by the Issuer, VMS and PHH in connection with any “roadshow” presentations to investors; and (l) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Issuer, PHH and VMS under this Agreement which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section 12; provided, however, that except as provided in this Section 12 and Section 8, the Initial Purchasers shall pay their own costs and expenses.

          13. Survival. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Issuer, VMS, PHH and the Initial Purchasers contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Issuer, Holdings, VMS, PHH or the Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any

24

          17. No Fiduciary Duty. Each of the Issuer, PHH and VMS acknowledge and agree that, in connection with the offering of the Securities contemplated hereunder or any other services the Initial Purchasers may be deemed to be providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by the Initial Purchasers: (i) no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Issuer, PHH, VMS and any other person, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, exists; (ii) the Initial Purchasers are not acting as advisor, expert or otherwise, to the Issuer, PHH or VMS, and such relationship between the Issuer, PHH and VMS, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, is entirely and solely commercial, based on arms-length negotiations; (iii) any duties and obligations that the Initial

25





 





Purchasers may have to the Issuer, PHH or VMS shall be limited to those duties and obligations specifically stated herein; and (iv) the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Issuer, PHH and VMS. The Issuer, PHH and VMS hereby waive any claims that the Issuer, PHH or VMS may have against the Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.

          18. No Petition.

EXHIBIT A

FORM OF OPINIONS OF WHITE & CASE LLP

          The Representatives shall have received the favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Date, of White & Case LLP, special counsel to the Issuer, SPV, PHH Sub 2, Holdings, VMS, PHH VMS Subsidiary Corporation (“VMS Sub”), PHH and the Origination Trust, in form and substance, and subject to such qualifications and assumptions as are, satisfactory to the Representatives and to counsel for the Initial Purchasers, addressed to the Initial Purchasers and to the effect that:

     (a) The Series 2009-2 Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes, Class A (the “Class A Notes”), the Series 2009-2 Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes, Class B (the “Class B Notes”), the Series 2009-2 Floating Rate Asset Backed Notes, Class C (the “Class C Notes” and, together with the Class A Notes and the Class B Notes, the “Securities” for purposes of this opinion), the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof contained in the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular.

     (b) The Securities are in the form contemplated by the Base Indenture and the Indenture Supplement, and when duly executed by the Issuer and authenticated by the Indenture Trustee in the manner provided in the Base Indenture and the Indenture Supplement and issued and delivered against payment of the purchase price therefor, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer, enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms and will be entitled to the benefits of the Base Indenture and the Indenture Supplement.

     (c) Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Issuer, VMS, VMS Sub, Holdings, PHH Sub 2, SPV, PHH or the Origination Trust (each, a “Party”) is a party, and which by its terms provides it is to be governed by New York law, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its terms, except (i) as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether the issue of enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) such counsel need not express an opinion as to the enforceability of any rights to indemnification which are violative of the public policy underlying any law, rule or regulation. For purposes of this opinion, the Transaction Documents shall include not only the “Transaction Documents” as defined in Schedule I to the Base Indenture but also the Indenture Supplement and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Holdings dated as of March 7, 2006 by and among VMS and the other parties named therein.

     (d) The statements in the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular under the headings “Risk factors—Holdings’ indirect ownership of the leases, the vehicles and the receivables could result in reduced payments to investors in the Series 2009-2 Notes”, “—Insolvency or bankruptcy of VMS could result in delayed or reduced payments to investors in the Series 2009-2 Notes” and “—Insolvency or bankruptcy of PHH Corporation could result in delayed or reduced payments to investors in the Series 2009-2 Notes”, “Material

Legal Aspects of the Origination Trust”, “Material Legal Aspects of the Leases and the Vehicles”, “Certain employee benefit plan considerations”, “Summary of terms of the Series 2009-2 Notes—Material federal and certain state income tax consequences” and “Material federal and certain state income tax consequences—U.S. federal income tax consequences”, to the extent that they constitute summaries of matters of law, documents or proceedings or legal conclusions relating to U.S. federal law, have been prepared or reviewed by such counsel and are correct in all material respects.

     (e) None of the Parties is an “investment company” as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     (f) The execution, delivery and performance by VMS, PHH and the Issuer of the Purchase Agreement, the issuance of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers and PHH and the offering of the Class A Notes, and the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Parties of each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation by each of the Parties of the applicable transactions provided for therein do not and will not (a) require any authorization, consent, approval, license or other action by or in respect of, or notice to or filing with, any federal or New York state governmental, legislative, judicial, administrative or regulatory body, agency or official, except for the filing of the applicable financing statements; or (b) contravene, violate or constitute a default under any provision of any federal or New York state law, rule or regulation or any order, writ, judgment or decree, of which such counsel is aware after due inquiry, of any New York State or federal court or governmental authority binding upon any such Party.

     (g) Assuming that the initial offer and sale of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers and PHH and any offer and resale of the Class A Notes by the Initial Purchasers are made in the manner and under the circumstances contemplated in the Purchase Agreement and in the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular, and assuming compliance by each of the Initial Purchasers with its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, it is not necessary in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers and PHH and to each subsequent purchaser in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and by the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular to qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.

     (h) It is not necessary to qualify the LLC Agreement or the Origination Trust Documents under the Trust Indenture Act.

     (i) The provisions of the Loan Agreement are effective to create a valid and enforceable security interest in the Lease SUBI and the Fleet Receivable SUBI and the other Loan Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement) in favor of the Issuer.

     (j) The provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement are effective to create a valid and enforceable ownership or security interest, as the case may be, in the Sold Assets (as defined therein).

     (k) The provisions of the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Receivables Assignments are effective to create a valid and enforceable ownership or security interest, as the





 





3

case may be, in the Transferred Fleet Receivables (as defined therein) described therein. The provisions of the Old Contribution Agreement are effective to create a valid and enforceable ownership or security interest, as the case may be, in the Assigned Assets (as defined in the Old Contribution Agreement) contributed to the Origination Trust pursuant thereto. The provisions of the Contribution Agreement are effective to create a valid and enforceable ownership or security interest, as the case may be, in the Assigned Assets (as defined in the Contribution Agreement) contributed to the Origination Trust pursuant thereto.

     (l) The provisions of the Indenture and the Series 2009-2 Indenture Supplement are effective to create a valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral and the Series 2009-2 Collateral and the Proceeds thereof in favor of the Indenture Trustee.

     (m) The provisions of the Security Agreement are effective to create a valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement) and the Proceeds (as defined in the Security Agreement) thereof in favor of the Issuer.

     (n) The provisions of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement are effective to convey to Holdings all of SPV’s right, title and interest in the Assigned Documents (as defined in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement).

     (o) Section 9-301 of the New York UCC provides that the local law of the jurisdiction in which a debtor is located governs perfection of a security interest in the collateral described in each of the financing statements naming VMS, SPV, VMS Sub, Holdings or the Issuer as debtor (the “Financing Statements”) and that the local law of the jurisdiction in which a debtor is located governs the effect of perfection or nonperfection and the priority of a non-possessory security interest in such collateral except to the extent that such collateral consists of negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money or tangible chattel paper. Section 9-301 of the New York UCC also provides that the local law of the jurisdiction in which the collateral is located governs the effect of the perfection or nonperfection and the priority of a nonpossessory security interest in negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money and tangible chattel paper.

     (p) VMS, SPV, VMS Sub, Holdings and the Issuer are located in the State of Delaware under Section 9-307(e) of the New York UCC.

     (q) The Lease SUBI Certificate is either an “instrument”, a “certificated security”, “tangible chattel paper” or a “general intangible”, as such terms are defined in the New York UCC. The Fleet Receivable SUBI Certificate is either an “instrument,” a “certificated security,” a “general intangible” or an “account,” as such terms are defined in the New York UCC.

     (r) Each Lease is either “tangible chattel paper” or a “general intangible,” as such terms are defined in the New York UCC.

     (s) With respect to the security interest in the SUBI Certificates granted to the Issuer by Holdings pursuant to the Loan Agreement:

     (I) Assuming that each of the SUBI Certificates is an “instrument” (as defined in the New York UCC), and has been delivered to, and is continually in the possession of the Issuer in the State of New York, the Issuer has a perfected





 





4

security interest in the SUBI Certificates, as determined in accordance with Article 9 of the New York UCC.

     (II) Assuming that (i) each of the SUBI Certificates is a “certificated security” (as defined in the New York UCC), and has been delivered to, and is continually in the possession of the Issuer in the State of New York and (ii) the SUBI Certificates are registered in the name of the Issuer, the Issuer has a perfected security interest in the SUBI Certificates, as determined in accordance with Article 9 of the New York UCC.

     (t) With respect to the delivery of the Collateral to the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and the Series 2009-2 Indenture Supplement:

     (a) Assuming that the Collateral is comprised of an “instrument” (as defined in the New York UCC), and has been delivered to, and is continually in the possession of, the Indenture Trustee in the State of New York, the Indenture Trustee has a perfected security interest in such Collateral, as determined in accordance with Article 9 of the New York UCC.

     (b) Assuming that (i) the Collateral is comprised of a “certificated security” (as defined in the New York UCC), and has been delivered to, and is continually in the possession of the Indenture Trustee in the State of New York and (ii) such Collateral is registered in the name of the Indenture Trustee or is endorsed to the Indenture Trustee or in blank by an effective endorsement, the Indenture Trustee has a perfected security interest in such Collateral, as determined in accordance with Article 9 of the New York UCC.

Such security interest will be perfected upon execution and delivery of the Series 2009-2 Indenture Supplement by the parties thereto and acquisition by the Indenture Trustee of such Security Entitlement as described above and will remain perfected so long as the Base Indenture and the Series 2009-2 Indenture Supplement remain in effect and the conditions set forth in this clause (A) are satisfied and the Indenture Trustee remains the Entitlement Holder of such Security Entitlement as described above;

     (B) such security interest in that portion of the Collateral consisting of a

     (ii) With respect to the security interest in any Collateral perfected as described in subparagraph (i) above, if such Collateral consists of a Securities Account or a Security Entitlement credited to a Securities Account and so long as such security interest therein is perfected in the manner specified in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (i) above, as applicable, and if such security interest was created for value and without notice (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the New York UCC) to the Indenture Trustee or the Series 2009-2 Investor Noteholders of any adverse claim (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(1) of the New York UCC) (an “Adverse Claim”) to such Securities Account or Security Entitlement in such Securities Account, such perfected security interest has priority over all other security interests theretofore or thereafter created under the New York UCC in such Securities Account or Security Entitlement (provided that (x) if the Indenture Trustee and another secured party both have control over such Securities Account and Security Entitlements, their interests will rank equally, except that any security interest granted to the Securities Intermediary in such Securities Account or Security Entitlement would have priority over the security interest therein of the Indenture Trustee unless otherwise agreed by the Securities Intermediary, and (y) such priority will be subject to Section 8-511 of the New York UCC, to the Bankruptcy Code and to liens or claims of the U.S. or otherwise given priority by operation of law, including New York or federal law).

Upon full compliance with the procedures set forth in the Base Indenture and the Collection Account Control Agreement in respect of a Permitted Investment, the Indenture Trustee will acquire a Security Entitlement carried in the Collection Account in respect of such Permitted Investment and will become the Entitlement Holder (as defined in the New York UCC) of such Security Entitlement. Such security interest will be perfected upon acquisition by the Indenture Trustee of such Security Entitlement as described above and will remain perfected so long as the Base Indenture and the Collection Account Control Agreement remain in effect and the conditions set forth in this clause (A) are satisfied and the Indenture Trustee remains the Entitlement Holder of such Security Entitlement as described above; and

     (B) such security interest in that portion of the Collateral consisting of the Collection Account will be perfected if and will remain perfected so long as the security interest of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Investor Noteholders, in all Security Entitlements carried in the Collection Account is





 





6

perfected by the means indicated in clause (A) above.

     (ii) With respect to the security interest in any Collateral perfected as described in subparagraph (i) above, so long as such security interest therein is perfected in the manner specified in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (i) above, as applicable, and if such security interest was created for value and without notice (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the New York UCC) to the Indenture Trustee or the Investor Noteholders of any Adverse Claim to the Collection Account or Security Entitlement in the Collection Account, such perfected security interest has priority over all other security interests theretofore or thereafter created under the New York UCC in the Collection Account or Security Entitlement (provided that such priority will be subject to Section 8-511 of the New York UCC, to the Bankruptcy Code and to liens or claims of the U.S. or otherwise given priority by operation of law, including New York or federal law).

     (e) (i)(A) The security interest in any portion of the Collateral consisting of a Security Entitlement carried in the Gain on Sale Account maintained by the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Investor Noteholders pursuant to and in accordance with the Base Indenture and the Gain on Sale Account Control Agreement, will attach upon acquisition by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee of rights in such Security Entitlement.

Such security interest will be perfected upon acquisition by the Indenture Trustee of such Security Entitlement as described above and will remain perfected so long as the Base Indenture and the Gain on Sale Account Control Agreement remain in effect and the conditions set forth in this clause (A) are satisfied and the Indenture Trustee remains the Entitlement Holder of such Security Entitlement as described above; and

     (B) such security interest in that portion of the Collateral consisting of the Gain on Sale Account will be perfected if, and will remain perfected so long as, the security interest of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Investor Noteholders, in all Security Entitlements carried in the Gain on Sale Account is perfected by the means indicated in clause (A) above.

     (ii) With respect to the security interest in any Collateral perfected as described in subparagraph (i) above, so long as such security interest therein is perfected in the manner specified in clauses (A) and (B) of subparagraph (i) above, as applicable, and if such security interest was created for value and without notice (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the New York UCC) to the Indenture Trustee or the Investor Noteholders of any Adverse Claim to the Gain on Sale Account or Security Entitlement in the Gain on Sale Account, such





 





7

perfected security interest has priority over all other security interests theretofore or thereafter created under the New York UCC in the Gain on Sale Account or Security Entitlement (provided that such priority will be subject to Section 8-511 of the New York UCC, to the Bankruptcy Code and to liens or claims of the U.S. or otherwise given priority by operation of law, including New York or federal law).

     (u) In the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to VMS under the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of Transferred Fleet Receivables (as defined in the Receivables Purchase Agreement) from VMS to SPV would not be recharacterized by a court as a pledge to secure borrowings but rather properly would be held as a valid sale or contribution, as applicable, of all of VMS’ right, title and interest in the Transferred Fleet Receivables and, therefore, a court properly would hold that (i) the Transferred Fleet Receivables and the proceeds thereof are not part of VMS’ bankruptcy estate under Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) the automatic stay under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code would not apply to the Transferred Fleet Receivables or the proceeds thereof.

     (v) In the event of the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to VMS under the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of Leases, Vehicles, Existing Interests and other Sold Assets (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) from VMS to SPV (the “VMS Transferred Assets”) would not be recharacterized by a court as a pledge to secure borrowings but rather properly would be held as a valid sale or contribution, as applicable, of all of VMS’ right, title and interest in the VMS Transferred Assets and, therefore, a court properly would hold that (i) the VMS Transferred Assets and the proceeds thereof are not part of VMS’ bankruptcy estate under Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) the automatic stay under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code would not apply to the VMS Transferred Assets or the proceeds thereof.

     (w) In a case under the Bankruptcy Code in which PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Issuer, Holdings or SPV) was the debtor, subject to certain facts, assumptions and qualifications specified therein, it would not be a proper exercise by a court of its equitable discretion to disregard the separate existence of the Origination Trust so as to order substantive consolidation under the Bankruptcy Code of the assets and liabilities of the Origination Trust with the bankruptcy estate of PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Issuer, Holdings or SPV).

     (x) In a case under the Bankruptcy Code in which PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Origination Trust or the Issuer) was the debtor, subject to certain facts, assumptions and qualifications specified therein, it would not be a proper exercise by a court of its equitable discretion to disregard the separate existence of SPV or the separate existence of Holdings so as to order substantive consolidation under the Bankruptcy Code of the assets and liabilities of SPV or Holdings with the bankruptcy estate of PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Issuer or the Origination Trust).

     (y) In a case under the Bankruptcy Code in which PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Origination Trust, Holdings or SPV) was the debtor, subject to certain facts, assumptions and qualifications specified therein, it would not be a proper exercise by a court of its equitable discretion to disregard the separate existence of the Issuer so as to order substantive





 





8

consolidation under the Bankruptcy Code of the assets and liabilities of the Issuer with the bankruptcy estate of PHH or any of its Affiliates (other than the Origination Trust, Holdings or SPV).

     (z) State law will govern the determination of what persons or entities have the authority to file a bankruptcy petition on behalf of a Delaware limited liability company.

     (aa) The Class A Notes are Eligible Collateral.

     (bb) The Securities will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax purposes.

     (cc) None of the Issuer, Holdings or the Origination Trust will be classified as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.

     (dd) Assuming that the initial offer and sale of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers and PHH and any offer and resale of the Class A Notes by the Initial Purchasers are made in the manner and under the circumstances contemplated in the Purchase Agreement and in the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Final Offering Circular, assuming compliance by each of the Initial Purchasers with its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement, it is not necessary in connection with the offer, sale, issuance and delivery of the Securities to register the Securities under the Securities Act.

     (ee) Although such counsel assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Preliminary Offering Circular or the Final Offering Circular (except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (d) above), nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that (i) the Preliminary Offering Circular (except for financial statements and other financial or statistical data set forth or incorporated by reference in the Preliminary Offering Circular, as to which such counsel need make no statement), at the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) the Final Offering Circular (except for financial statements and other financial or statistical data set forth or incorporated by reference in the Final Offering Circular, as to which such counsel need make no statement), as of its date or as of Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (a) Each Specified Security constitutes Eligible Collateral.

 





 





          (b) The certifications contained in the Issuer Documents are true and correct, and the Issuer Parties will promptly pay and perform their obligations under the Issuer Documents.
