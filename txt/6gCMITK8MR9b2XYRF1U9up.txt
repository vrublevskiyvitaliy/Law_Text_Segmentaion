The Merger shall become effective at the time of the acceptance of the certificate of merger by the Ohio Secretary of State (the “Effective Time”).

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 2.04 Articles of Incorporation; Regulations.

All of the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall resign from their positions as directors effective as of the Effective Time.

ARTICLE III.

CONVERSION OF SHARES AND OPTIONS

     Section 3.01 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

     (a) Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Common Shares cancelled in accordance with Section 3.01(c) and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), if any) will be converted into the right to receive (i) the Common Price Per Share, plus (ii) the Per Security Common Escrow Amount (in each case, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) (it being understood that such Common Shares do not include Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of Options) (the “Common Merger Consideration”), payable to the holder thereof upon the surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.04, of the Certificate(s) (as hereinafter defined) that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced such Common Shares. From and after the Effective Time, all such Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Common Share, by virtue of being a holder of Common Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Common Share in accordance with Section 3.04.

     (b) Each Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Preferred Shares canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(c)), will be converted into the right to receive (i) the Preferred Price Per Share, plus (ii) the Per Security Preferred Escrow Amount (in each case, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), payable to the holder thereof upon the surrender, in the manner provided in Section 3.04, of the Certificate(s) that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced such Preferred Shares (the “Preferred Merger Consideration”, and together with the Common Merger Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all such Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Preferred Share, by virtue of being a holder of Preferred Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Preferred Share in accordance with Section 3.04.

     (c) Each Share that is held in the Company’s treasury shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, without the payment of any consideration therefor.

13





 





     (d) Each common share, no par value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 3.02 Employee Stock Options. The Company shall terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans, as amended through the date of this Agreement. Effective at or prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Common Shares (each, an “Option”) granted under the Company Stock Option Plans that is outstanding and unexercised prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be either (i) exercised or terminated prior to the Effective Time or (ii) cancelled as of the Effective Time to the extent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the obligations of the Surviving Corporation in the immediately following sentence). Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per share that is less than the sum of (x) the Common Price Per Share and (y) the Per Security Holdback Amount, shall be entitled to be paid by the Surviving Corporation in exchange for the cancellation of such Option, (a) promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), with respect to each Share subject to the Option, equal to the excess, if any, of the Common Price Per Share over the applicable per share exercise price of such Option, and (b) the Per Security Common Escrow Amount (the “Option Merger Consideration”). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board shall (to the extent necessary) adopt resolutions and take all such other actions reasonably required to implement the provisions of this Section 3.02, it being understood that the intention of the parties is that following the Effective Time no holder of any Options shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof.

     Section 3.03 Dissenters’ Rights. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by the OGCL, Shares that are issued and outstanding as of the date fixed by the Company Board for the determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting at which this Agreement is proposed to be adopted by the Shareholders (or other applicable date under the OGCL in the event this Agreement is adopted by written consent of the Shareholders) and that are held by any Person that is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair value of such Shares pursuant to, and that complies in all respects with, Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the applicable Merger Consideration. Such Shareholders shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and subject to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL; provided, however, that if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost such holder’s right to be paid fair value under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid fair value for such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration (without any interest thereon and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), upon surrender of the Certificate(s) that formerly evidenced such Shares, in the manner provided in Section 3.04.

14





 





     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for payment of the fair value of any Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value under the OGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair value or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     Section 3.04 Surrender of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration.

     (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will select a bank or trust company in the United States, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration due hereunder to the Shareholders upon surrender of the Certificates formerly representing Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent in cash the aggregate amount of the Closing Net Consideration, less the Closing Option Amount (the “Payment Fund”). The Payment Fund will not be used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Paying Agent will invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis, provided such investments shall be limited to direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, respectively, or certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having at least $25 billion in assets. No investment income or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Shares. Any interest and other income or gain resulting from such investments shall not be part of the Payment Fund, and shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, payable to Parent upon its request.

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within three Business Days thereof, the Surviving Corporation or Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more certificates representing ownership of Shares (the “Certificates”), (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Annex A, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable portion of the Payment Fund. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and executed, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash equal to the Common Price Per Share or the Preferred Price Per Share, as applicable, for each of the Shares previously represented by such Certificate (in each case, subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered will immediately thereafter be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.04, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time from and after

15





 





the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01 payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate, without any interest thereon. If any holder of Shares is unable to surrender such holder’s Certificates because such Certificates have been lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder shall deliver in lieu thereof an affidavit in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, and, if reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, post a bond in such amount as may be directed by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, as indemnity against any claim that may be made in respect of such Certificate.

     (c) At least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide to Parent a list of all holders of Options for which payment is to be made promptly after the Effective Time pursuant to Section 3.02. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within three Business Days thereof, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each such Option Holder the amount of cash equal to the excess of the Common Price Per Share over the applicable per share exercise price for each Share subject to such Option (without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax).

     (d) After the Effective Time there will be no further registration on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of (i) transfers of Shares or (ii) the exercise of Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the Shareholders six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any Shareholder that has not previously complied with this Section 3.04 will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for payment of such Shareholder’s claim for the Merger Consideration, without interest.

     (f) None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or counsel, will be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 3.04, Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to pay immediately following the Effective Time, to each Shareholder by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds, the portion of the Payment Fund (less any applicable withholding Taxes) payable to such Shareholder, if such Shareholder has delivered to the Paying Agent properly executed letters of transmittal (in the form required by this Section 3.04), wire transfer instructions and the Certificates evidencing such Shares of such Shareholder, a reasonable time prior to the Effective Time. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Holdback Amount. No later than five Business Days prior to the anticipated date of the Closing, Parent will deliver to the Company a sufficient number of copies of (i) an acceptable form of letter of transmittal so as to permit each Shareholder to exercise his, her or its right to payment immediately after the Effective Time as provided in this Section 3.04(g), and (ii) any documents required by Parent to be executed by Option Holders so as to permit each Option Holder to receive the payment promptly after the Effective Time as provided in

16





 





Section 3.04(c), and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to deliver such materials, or otherwise make such materials available, to each such Shareholder or Option Holder as promptly as reasonably practicable.

     (h) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Dissenting Shares for which demands for payment of the fair value have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation upon demand.

     (i) Each time the Escrow Agent is required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to release amounts from:

          (i) the Adjustment Reserve Fund (as defined below) or the Securityholders’ Fund (as defined below), as applicable, the Escrow Agent shall (A) pay to the Paying Agent the Per Security Adjustment Amount or the Per Security Fund Amount, as applicable, then being distributed for all Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with instructions to the Paying Agent to promptly distribute to each Shareholder such Shareholder’s Pro Rata Share of such amount for each Share for which such Shareholder received Merger Consideration, and with respect to any Shares for which the Certificates and other required documents have not been delivered and Merger Consideration has not been paid, upon delivery of such Certificates and other documents, and (B) pay to Parent the Per Security Adjustment Amount or the Per Security Fund Amount, as applicable, then being distributed for all Options and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly thereafter pay each Option Holder such Option Holder’s Pro Rata Share of such amount for each Share underlying such Option Holder’s Options (in each case, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax).

          (ii) the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall (A) pay to the Paying Agent the Per Security Preferred Escrow Amount then being distributed for all Preferred Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with instructions to the Paying Agent to promptly distribute to each holder of Preferred Shares the Per Security Preferred Escrow Amount for such Shareholder’s Preferred Shares for which such Shareholder received Merger Consideration, and with respect to any Preferred Shares for which the Certificates and other required documents have not been delivered and Merger Consideration has not been paid, upon delivery of such Certificates and other documents, and (B) pay to the Paying Agent the Per Security Common Escrow Amount then being distributed for all Common Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with instructions to the Paying Agent to promptly distribute to each holder of Common Shares the Per Security Common Escrow Amount for such Shareholder’s Common Shares for which such Shareholder received Merger Consideration, and with respect to any Common Shares for which the Certificates and other required documents have not been delivered and Merger Consideration has not been paid, upon delivery of such Certificates and other documents and (C) pay to Parent the Per Security Common Escrow Amount then being distributed for all Options and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly thereafter pay each Option Holder the Per Security Common Escrow Amount for each Share underlying such Option Holder’s Options (in each case, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax).

17





 





     Section 3.05 Closing Net Working Capital and Cash Adjustment.

     (a) On the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company will deliver to Parent its determination of Specified Cash, and the parties shall use good faith efforts to agree on the amount of Credit Agreement Debt, the fees and expenses payable to William Blair & Company, LLC, and other fees and expenses, including legal and accounting fees and expenses, payable in connection with this Agreement, the Bonus Obligations, and the Aggregate Option Exercise Amount, for purposes of calculating the Closing Net Consideration.

     (b) Within 30 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Securityholder Agent Parent’s good faith determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, and in conjunction therewith the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and, based thereupon, Parent’s determination of the Closing Net Working Capital and the Capital Adjustment Amount, if any, and the Cash Adjustment Amount, if any.

     (c) The Securityholder Agent may object to Parent’s determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Cash Adjustment Amount or the Capital Adjustment Amount by delivery of a written statement of objections (stating the basis thereof with reasonable specificity) to Parent within 30 days following delivery to the Securityholder Agent of Parent’s determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Capital Adjustment Amount, if any, and the Cash Adjustment Amount, if any (the “Adjustment Objection Period”). After Parent’s delivery of its good faith determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Capital Adjustment Amount, if any, and the Cash Adjustment Amount, if any, the Securityholder Agent shall be given reasonable access to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and shall be permitted to inquire of the officers and accountants of the Surviving Corporation and Parent as such Securityholder Agent may reasonably deem necessary, in each case to the extent related to questions or otherwise concerning the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Net Working Capital and the Capital Adjustment Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount.

     (d) If the Securityholder Agent does not make such an objection during the Adjustment Objection Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital proposed by Parent and, based thereupon, the Capital Adjustment Amount, and the Cash Adjustment Amount each shall be considered final and binding upon the parties and each of the Securityholders.

     (e) If the Securityholder Agent makes such an objection during the Adjustment Objection Period, Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall seek in good faith to resolve all disagreements set forth in the Securityholder Agent’s written statement of objections within 10 Business Days following delivery to Parent of the Securityholder Agent’s written statement of objections (the “Adjustment Resolution Period”).

     (f) If Parent and the Securityholder Agent cannot agree on the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Net Working Capital, the Capital Adjustment Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount during the Adjustment Resolution Period,

18





 





either Parent (on the one hand) or the Securityholder Agent (on the other hand) may elect, by written notice given to the other within five Business Days after conclusion of the Adjustment Resolution Period (the “Adjustment Election Period”), to have such disagreement resolved by the Independent Accountant, whose determination shall be final and binding. For purposes of clarity, the parties may submit to the Independent Accountant any or all of the foregoing disagreements; and the Independent Accountant shall make no determination regarding items on which the parties agree. If any disagreement is submitted to the Independent Accountant, Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall promptly execute in favor of the Independent Accountant such engagement letters and related agreements, and shall provide all documentation, in each case, reasonably requested by the Independent Accountant, to enable the Independent Accountant to perform its duties under this Section.

     (g) If neither Parent nor the Securityholder Agent makes such an election during the Adjustment Election Period, the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the Closing Net Working Capital proposed by Parent and, based thereupon, the Capital Adjustment Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount shall be considered final and binding upon the parties and each of the Securityholders.

     (h) If either Parent or the Securityholder Agent makes an election during the Adjustment Election Period to have the determination made by the Independent Accountant, the Independent Accountant shall make final and binding determinations of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Capital Adjustment Amount and the Cash Adjustment Amount using GAAP and the methodology set forth on Schedule 3.05(h) and, based thereupon, the final amount of the Common Price Per Share. No appeal from such determination shall be permitted. The Independent Accountant shall be instructed to use every reasonable effort to perform its services within 10 Business Days (and in any case as soon as practicable) after its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the written objection of Parent (together with any other documentation requested) and the Capital Adjustment Amount and Cash Adjustment Amount proposed by each of the Securityholder Agent and Parent, as applicable. The fees and expenses for the services of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the party whose proposed Capital Adjustment Amount, proposed Cash Adjustment Amount or if both are in dispute, the Net Adjustment Amount (as defined below), as applicable, had the greater difference between it and the Capital Adjustment Amount, Cash Adjustment Amount or if both are in dispute, the Net Adjustment Amount, as applicable, finally determined by the Independent Accountant (and, if such fees and expenses are paid by the Securityholders, such amount shall be taken from the Adjustment Reserve Fund, and if such Fund shall be insufficient to pay such fees and costs owed by to the Independent Accountant, from the Securityholders’ Fund, and if such Fund is insufficient, such deficiency may, in the discretion of Parent, be paid from the Escrow Fund). In making its decision, the Independent Accountant shall be limited by the amounts proposed by the parties and shall not award an amount higher than the highest amount proposed by a party or lower than the lowest amount proposed by a party. Judgment upon any award or decision by the Independent Accountant may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

     (i) If the sum of the Capital Adjustment Amount and Cash Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.05 (the “Net Adjustment Amount”) shall be:

19





 





          (i) a negative amount, then Parent shall have the right to immediately withdraw from the Adjustment Reserve Fund the Net Adjustment Amount (and if the Net Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount in the Adjustment Reserve Fund, then from the Escrow Fund); or

          (ii) a positive amount, then, within five Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount, Parent shall (A) pay to the Paying Agent the Per Security Adjustment Amount attributable to all Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, with instructions to the Paying Agent to distribute to each Shareholder the Per Security Adjustment Amount for each Share for which such Shareholder received Merger Consideration, and with respect to any Shares for which the Certificates and other required documents have not been delivered, upon delivery of such Certificates and other documents, and (B) pay to each Option Holder the Per Security Adjustment Amount attributable to such Option Holder’s Options.

     Section 3.06 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholder or Option Holder in respect of whose Shares or Options such deduction and withholding was made.

     Section 3.07 Escrow Accounts.

     (a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the Holdback Amount with the Escrow Agent in three separate escrow accounts. The parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to invest the Holdback Amount as directed by Parent and the Securityholder Agent (by mutual agreement), provided such investments shall be limited to direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, respectively, or certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having at least $25 billion in assets; provided, further, that the foregoing investment limitations may be modified by mutual agreement of Parent and the Securityholder Agent.

          (i) The Escrow Cash shall be deposited in the Escrow Fund, which shall be used to pay Losses, if any, incurred by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

          (ii) The Securityholders’ Amount shall be deposited in an account (the “Securityholders’ Fund”), which shall be used to reimburse the Securityholder Agent for out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties hereunder, including fees of attorneys and accountants employed by the Securityholder Agent necessary to discharge his or her duties as Securityholder Agent on behalf of the Securityholders as set forth herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Securityholder Agent may, at any time on or after the second (2nd) Business Day following the date that all amounts are paid pursuant to Section 3.05(i), and in the Securityholder Agent’s sole discretion, direct the Escrow Agent to distribute funds from the

In addition, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees

43





 





of the Company in the respective plan year in which the Effective Time occurs; and provided, further, that all Pre-Closing Service shall be counted for purposes of determining the level of benefits under any vacation plan following the Effective Time established or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) that is extended to Company Employees and (ii) following the Effective Time, all Company Employees shall be entitled to continue to use all unused vacation time accrued as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of Parent’s vacation policy.

     (c) The Company shall pay to each of the Company Employees on or before the date for payment provided in the Company’s 2009 annual bonus compensation plan all accrued bonus compensation payable to such Company Employee with respect to the 2009 Employee Bonuses.

     (d) The Company and certain current employees of the Company are parties to the Change in Control Agreements described in Section 7.04(d) of the Disclosure Schedule (the “Change in Control Agreements”). From and after the Effective Time, Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation (and its successors and assigns) to honor the Change in Control Agreements in accordance with their terms.

     Section 7.05 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.

     (a) The articles of incorporation and regulations of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than those set forth in the Company’s Articles and Regulations in effect on the date hereof, which provisions, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company.

     (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered on the date of this Agreement by the current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not, in the aggregate, less favorable to any beneficiary thereof; provided, further, that (i) Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such 200% amount, the “Maximum Premium”); and (ii) if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors’ and officers’ insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, in its sole discretion, may elect, by giving written notice to the Company at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, for the Company to purchase, effective as of the Effective Time, a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance “tail”

44





 





insurance program for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount at least equal to the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability policy, and shall be no less advantageous on the whole to such existing coverage, or such insurance to the extent such premiums do not exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance); and in such event, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 7.05(b) for so long as such “tail” policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is as set forth in Schedule 7.05(b). Nothing contained in this Section 7.05(b) or otherwise in this Agreement is intended to or shall relieve any of the Company’s existing insurance carriers from any obligations that such carriers now have or may in the future have relating to the Company and any of its officers and directors.

     (c) In addition to the other rights provided for in this Section 7.05, and not in limitation thereof, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company agree that all individual indemnity agreements between the Company and any persons who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were officers or directors of the Company or served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, as in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Effective Time and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

     (d) The provisions of this Section 7.05 will survive the Effective Time and are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and his or her heirs and representatives. Parent will pay or cause to be paid all expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, that an Indemnitee may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 7.05.

     (e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume their respective obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

     (f) For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section 7.05, including any indemnification obligations arising from the directors’ actions in connection with approving the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, shall be Losses to the extent the Surviving Corporation’s indemnification obligations are the result of or arise from matters subject to indemnification under Article X.

     Section 7.06 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, as applicable, of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which reasonably could be

45





 





expected to cause any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (b) any failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder and (c) as to the Company, any other material development relating to it; provided, however, that a failure to timely comply with this Section 7.06 will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VIII or Article IX to be satisfied unless the underlying event would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII or Article IX to be satisfied. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.06 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

     Section 7.07 Further Action; Reasonable Efforts.

     (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (i) each of the parties hereto shall make promptly its respective filings under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger, and (ii) (y) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.03 as promptly as practicable, and (z) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02, as promptly as practicable, including, in each case, using commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders of Governmental Authorities as are necessary for the consummation of the Merger.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, file with the FTC and the DOJ the notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act (“HSR Filing”) required for the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party’s HSR Filing shall comply in all respects with the requirements of the HSR Act and other applicable Laws, and the Company and Parent shall request early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, provide to the FTC, DOJ and each and every federal, state, local or foreign Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition laws all non-privileged information and documents requested by such Governmental Authority or that are reasonably necessary or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall inform the other promptly of any communication made by or on behalf of such party to (including permitting the other party to review such communication in advance), or received from, any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall furnish to the other such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing, submission or other act that is necessary or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions under applicable Law. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall furnish the other party with copies of all substantive or otherwise material correspondence, filings, and written communications between such party and its Affiliates or their respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the parties shall not have an obligation to exchange any information that constitutes “business secrets,” including Item 4(c) attachments to the

46





 





notification form required by the HSR Act. Neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other parties in advance, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other party of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Payment for the filing fee for the HSR Filing shall be divided equally between Parent and the Company.

     (c) Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid, resolve or eliminate each and every objection raised by the FTC, DOJ or any state antitrust Governmental Authority to the Merger asserted, or suit challenging the Merger instituted, or other impediment to the Merger under any antitrust or competition Law, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Parent with respect to the foregoing, to the extent requested by Parent.

     (d) For purposes of this Section 7.07, “commercially reasonable efforts” shall not require Parent to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its or its Affiliates’ assets or operations or the assets or operations to be acquired by it pursuant to the Merger, or (ii) any limitation or restriction on Parent’s freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, any of its or its Affiliates’ assets or operations or the assets or operations to be acquired by it pursuant to the Merger.

     (e) None of the parties hereto shall, or shall permit their respective Subsidiaries to, consummate another transaction or enter into an agreement with respect to another transaction or take any other action if the intent or reasonably likely anticipated consequence of such transaction or action is, or would be, to cause any Governmental Authority to delay or not grant approval of, or to take legal action to seek to prevent, the consummation, in whole or in part, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (f) Parent’s and the Company’s obligations under this Section 7.07 shall include the obligation to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including using their respective commercially reasonable efforts to seek to have any stay or other injunctive relief which, if entered, would prohibit or materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement entered by any court or other Governmental Authority reversed on appeal or vacated.

     (g) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain all consents or approvals required by it from third parties other than Governmental Authorities in order to consummate the

47





 





transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, on terms that are not materially burdensome to the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 7.08 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all commercially reasonable action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent unconditionally guarantees the full and complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of their respective obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Common Merger Consideration, the Preferred Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration, and shall be jointly and severally liable with Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation for any breach of any covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement.

     Section 7.09 Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, (i) prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger, and (ii) for the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending nine (9) months thereafter, each of Parent on the one hand, and the Securityholder Agent, on the other hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Securityholders, in their capacity as such (other than (A) with respect to information set forth in this Agreement or (B) in response to a public statement made by a Securityholder), except (in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above) to the extent disclosure is legally required (including the requirements and rules of any stock exchange on which the common stock of Parent is traded), in which case the Company (or the Securityholder Agent, as applicable) and Parent shall consult with each other, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the text prior to any such disclosure, to the extent reasonably feasible under the circumstances. In addition, Parent may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section 7.09.

     Section 7.10 Tax Matters

     (a) Books and Records. Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Effective Time until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to such taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority.

     (b) Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

          (i) The Company shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of the Closing and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice. The Company shall provide Parent with copies of such completed Tax Returns at least twenty days prior to the

48





 





due date for filing thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Parent’s review and approval. The Company and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the Company and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns at least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 7.10(e), which resolution shall be binding on the Securityholders.

          (ii) Following the Closing, Parent shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company after the date of the Closing and, subject to the rights to payment from the Securityholders under Section 7.10(b)(iii), pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. Unless required by applicable Tax Laws or Governmental Authority, Parent agrees that it will not accelerate (or permit to be accelerated) the payment of any Tax into any taxable period ending on or prior to Closing or into the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the date of the Closing or amend (or permit to be amended) any Tax Returns for taxable periods ending on or prior to Closing or for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the date of the Closing to increase the amount of Taxes due from the Company thereon or which would otherwise adversely affect the Securityholders, and if Parent does so, the Securityholders and the Company shall have no obligation or liability therefor. As to any Tax Returns for which Parent may have claims for indemnification of Taxes under Section 10.02, Parent shall provide the Securityholder Agent with copies of all such Tax Returns at least 20 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (taking into account extensions thereof), along with supporting workpapers, for the Securityholder Agent’s review and approval. The Securityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the Securityholder Agent and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 7.10(e), which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

          (iii) Parent and the Company shall report all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the date of the Closing but after the Effective Time on Parent’s federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

          (iv) Not later than ten days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes on any Tax Returns that Parent has the responsibility to cause to be filed pursuant to Section 7.10(b)(ii), Parent shall be entitled to receive out of the Escrow Fund, the amount of Taxes, as reasonably determined by Parent, owed by the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be entitled to payment from the Escrow Fund prior to the time of payment for any Taxes if Parent or Surviving Corporation fails to provide such Tax Returns to the Securityholder Agent for review and approval pursuant to Section 7.10(b)(ii), but only to the extent that the Securityholders are materially prejudiced thereby, or if the Securityholder Agent is disputing the right of Parent to such indemnification pursuant to Section 7.10(e).

     (c) Straddle Period Tax Allocation. The Company will, unless prohibited by applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Company as of the close of business on the date of the Closing. If applicable Law does not permit the Company to close its taxable year on the

49





 





date of the Closing or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period that includes the date of the Closing (but does not begin or end on that day) (a “Straddle Period”), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to the Securityholders for the period up to and including the close of business on the date of the Closing, and (ii) to Parent for the period subsequent to the date of the Closing. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company as of the close of business on the date of the Closing, provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the date of the Closing and the period after the date of the Closing in proportion to the number of days in each such period. Any Tax Returns including any Straddle Period shall be provided by Parent to the Securityholder Agent at least twenty days prior to the due date for filing thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for the Securityholder Agent’s review and approval. The Securityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the event that the Securityholder Agent and Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns at least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 7.10(e), which resolution shall be binding on the parties.

     (d) Transfer Taxes. Each Securityholders shall be liable for and shall pay (and shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent against) all sales, use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Authority, including any interest and penalties, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as they relate to such Securityholder.

     (e) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by the parties and will be deducted from the Securityholders’ Fund, on the one hand, and paid directly by Parent on the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner that the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct. If the dispute is subsequently resolved and the original Tax Return is determined to have been incorrectly filed, the party responsible for filing such Tax Return shall file an amended Tax Return reflecting the resolution of the dispute.

     (f) Refunds for Pre-Closing Periods. The Surviving Corporation will promptly distribute or cause to be distributed to each Securityholder such Securityholder’s Pro Rata Share of any refunds for Taxes (i) received by the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time and prior to the date all amounts in the Escrow Fund are paid or distributed pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) relating to any period prior to Closing or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the date of Closing; provided, that no distribution shall be required to the extent any such refund is included as a Current Asset in the Closing Net Working Capital Statement.

     Section 7.11 Payoff Letters. The Company shall (i) at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the Closing, obtain and provide to Parent a payoff letter for all outstanding Indebtedness under that certain Business Loan Agreement dated as of April 2, 2009, between the

50





 





Company, as borrower, and Chase Bank, N.A., as lender, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide to Parent, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the Closing, a payoff letter for the Loan Agreement dated as of February 15, 2008, between the Company, as borrower, and The Director of Development of the State of Ohio, as lender (together, the “Payoff Letters”), in each case, including related documentation, including any applicable per diem amounts and any penalty interest, prepayment penalties, exit fees or other penalties due as a result of the repayment of such Indebtedness at the Closing (the “Payoff Amounts”); provided, that if Parent provides the Company with notice at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Closing of Parent’s intent to keep the Loan Agreement described in clause (ii) above in effect after the Closing, then the Company shall not be required to seek or obtain a Payoff Letter regarding such Loan Agreement and shall instead obtain the consent required under such Loan Agreement as contemplated by Schedule 8.03(f) or, if such consent cannot be obtained prior to the Closing, notwithstanding the Company’s commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent within such period, retire all Indebtedness under such Loan Agreement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Chase Bank, N.A. and The Director of Development of the State of Ohio, as applicable, or their successors, to keep the Payoff Letters in full force and effect until the Closing and to release any Liens related to such Indebtedness as of the Closing.

(i) (x) Each of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement that is qualified by reference to “materiality” or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, except to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of another date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be so true and correct as of such other date; and (y) each of the representations and warranties of the Company that is not qualified by reference to “materiality” or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, except, to the extent such representations and warranties are made as of another date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be so true and correct as of such other date, except in the case of either clause (x) or (y) where any failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct either individually or in the aggregate has not and is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Company at or before the Effective Time shall have been complied with in all material respects; and (iii) Parent shall have received a certificate from a duly authorized officer of the Company to the foregoing effect.

     (b) Dissenting Shares. A demand for fair value of the Shares under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL shall not have been perfected, asserted or demanded with respect to more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate number of Shares.

52





 





employment with (or have given notice that they do not intend to continue their employment with) the Surviving Corporation after the date of the Closing.

     (g) No Injunctions or Regulatory Proceedings. There shall be no Action of any nature pending by or before any Governmental Authority, and no injunction or other Order or Law shall be in effect; nor shall there be any Law or Order enacted, entered enforced or deemed applicable (A) requiring Parent to hold separate the assets of Parent, or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), (B) restricting Parent from exercising full voting rights with respect to its shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or (C) that would permit consummation of the Merger only if certain sales, licenses or divestitures were made or if Parent were to agree to material limitations on the business activities or operations of any of it or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), or (D) requiring Parent to incur any material Losses in connection therewith.

     (h) FIRPTA Certificate.

ARTICLE IX.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     Section 9.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

     (a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company;

     (b) By either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2010 (the “Outside Date”); provided that such Outside Date may be extended until May 15, 2010, by written notice from either Parent or the Company to the other if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions with respect to actions the respective parties will take at the Closing itself) have been satisfied or waived as of the Outside Date, except that (i) all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act have not expired or been terminated or (ii) an Order (whether preliminary or permanent) has been entered by a Governmental Authority which had the effect of enjoining the consummation of the Merger (other than a final and nonappealable Order) or (iii) the consent set forth on Schedule 8.03(f)(i)

53





 





shall not have been received by the parties; provided that the right to extend the Outside Date or terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available to (A) Parent if its or Merger Sub’s failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date or (B) the Company if its failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

     (c) By either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order prohibiting consummation of the Merger, and, in the case of an Order, such Order shall have become final and nonappealable;

     (d) By Parent, in the event of a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant that would cause any condition contained in Sections 8.01 or 8.03 not to be satisfied, which breach, if capable of cure, shall not have been cured within ten Business Days of receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent specifying such breach;

     (e) By the Company, in the event of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty or covenant that would cause any condition contained in Sections 8.01 or 8.02 not to be satisfied, which breach, if capable of cure, shall not have been cured within ten Business Days of receipt by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, of written notice from the Company specifying such breach;

     (f) By Parent if any of the conditions contained in Sections 8.01 or 8.03 (other than a breach by the Company as addressed in Section 9.01(d)) shall have become incapable of fulfillment as of the Effective Time; provided that the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(f) shall not be available to Parent if its or Merger Sub’s failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of such condition to be capable of fulfillment;

     (g) By the Company if any of the conditions contained in Sections 8.01 or 8.02 (other than a breach by Parent or Merger Sub as addressed in Section 9.01(e)) shall have become incapable of fulfillment as of the Effective Time; provided that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.01(g) shall not be available to the Company if its failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of such condition to be capable of fulfillment; or

     (h) By the Company or Parent if the Requisite Shareholder Approvals are not obtained by January 31, 2010.

     Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated, and there shall be no further liability on the part of any party hereto or their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives (including claims for breach of contract, tort or other theory), except that (a) Section 7.02(b), this Section 9.02 and Article XI shall survive termination and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any

54





 





party from liability or damages arising out of any fraud or intentional or willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

     Section 9.03 Amendment and Waiver. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, any provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived (i) prior to the Effective Time by the parties hereto, by action taken by or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, if and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Parent or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective and (ii) after the Effective Time, by Parent and the Securityholder Agent if and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Parent and the Securityholder Agent or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that, after the Requisite Shareholder Approvals are obtained, no such amendment shall be made without approval of the Company’s Shareholders except as allowed under applicable Law. Any waiver of any term shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X.

SURVIVAL, INDEMNIFICATION AND ESCROW

     Section 10.01 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall not terminate at the Effective Time or merge into the Closing, and shall continue for a period ending eighteen (18) months after the date of the Closing (the “Expiration Date”), except for Section 3.04, Section 7.05 and those other covenants or obligations that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Expiration Date, which covenants or obligations shall continue for the periods set forth therein. Nothing herein shall limit, or be deemed to limit, the rights of Parent or the Surviving Corporation against any Securityholder arising under any other agreement that such Securityholder has with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, including the Support Agreements and the Employment Agreement.

     Section 10.02 Indemnification and Escrow Arrangements.

     (a) Escrow Fund and Indemnification. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, by approval and adoption of this Agreement, each of the Securityholders agrees to indemnify Parent and hold Parent harmless for an aggregate amount not to exceed such Securityholder’s Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund for claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including Taxes, reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, and expenses of investigation and defense (calculated after deduction for insurance proceeds and any other amounts recovered therefor) incurred by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a result of or arising out of:

     (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

     (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant contained herein prior to the Effective Time;

55





 





     (iii) any payment or payments ordered to be made by a court of competent jurisdiction (or agreed upon in settlement in lieu thereof, subject to the prior written consent of the Securityholder Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that would have been payable (or Parent reasonably expects to be paid) in respect of such Shares if they were not Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement, and any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in respect of any claims relating to Dissenting Shares;

     (iv) any claim made by any Person that such Person is or was entitled (by contract or otherwise) to receive any amount or property in such Person’s capacity (or asserted capacity) as a holder of capital stock or other equity interests in the Company or similar synthetic or contractual interests in excess of the consideration to be received by such Person pursuant to this Agreement, other than any claim described in clause (iii) above; and

     (v) any Unpaid Taxes of the Company (A) for any taxable period ending on or before the date of the Closing, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the date of the Closing (determined as provided in Section 7.10(c)); provided, however there shall be no obligation to indemnify Parent for any Unpaid Taxes resulting from any transaction engaged in by the Company not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the date of the Closing but after the Effective Time.

Such claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses are referred to herein individually as a “Loss” and collectively as “Losses.” For the avoidance of doubt, the concept of “indemnity” as used in this Article X is intended to include, among others, claims between or among the parties to this Agreement and not involving any other Person, as well as third-party claims. The right to indemnification of Parent and the Surviving Corporation based upon the Company’s representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time. The adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Company’s Shareholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the appointment of the Securityholder Agent.

     The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and the Surviving Corporation for any Losses. The indemnity obligations of the Securityholders shall be limited to the Escrow Fund and no Securityholder shall be liable to Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement for any indemnity amount other than its proportionate share of the Escrow Fund from the Escrow Fund. After the Effective Time, the right of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such parties with respect to any inaccuracy or breach in any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Support Agreements, the Non-Solicit Agreement and the Employment Agreement) or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except in the case of fraud or knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement (the remedies for which

56





 





are outside and separate from the scope of these indemnification provisions). Parent may not receive any amounts from the Escrow Fund for Losses arising under Section 10.02(a)(i) or (ii) unless and until Officer’s Certificates (as defined in paragraph (e) below) identifying cumulative Losses arising under Section 10.02(a)(i) or (ii) in an amount exceeding $750,000 (the “Basket Amount”) have been delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in paragraph (e), subject to the right of the Securityholder Agent to object; and in such case, Parent may recover from the Escrow Fund the entire amount of such cumulative Losses, including the Basket Amount. Unless and until such cumulative Losses exceed the Basket Amount, Parent may not recover any amounts from the Escrow Fund for Losses arising under Section 10.02(a)(i) or (ii), provided that, with respect to Losses arising from a breach of any of the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05(a)(i), 4.14 and 4.20, the Basket Amount shall be inapplicable and, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article X, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be indemnified for the first dollar of Losses arising thereunder. For the purpose of quantifying a Loss under this Article X only (but not for determining whether any representation or warranty has been breached or is inaccurate), any representation or warranty of the Company that is qualified in scope as to materiality (including a Material Adverse Effect) shall be deemed to be made or given without such qualifications. There shall be no right of contribution for any Securityholder from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by Surviving Corporation or Parent, and in no event shall any Securityholder be entitled to require that any claim be first made or brought against any other Person, including the Surviving Corporation. No limit on indemnification in this Section 10.02 shall limit, or be deemed to limit, the rights of Parent or the Surviving Corporation against any Securityholder arising (i) under the letter of transmittal delivered by such Stockholder or the other documents delivered by such Securityholder pursuant to Section 3.04 or (ii) under any other agreement that such Securityholder has with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, including the Support Agreements, the Support Agreement and the Employment Agreement.

     For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that any Securityholder asserts a claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the former officers or directors of the Company alleging that such Securityholder was entitled to receive, in respect of such Securityholder’s Shares or Options, an amount of the Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration that is greater than the amount of Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration received or to be received by such Securityholder under the terms of the Merger Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, as a result of a payment that was consistent with the terms of Article III of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, then nothing in the Merger Agreement shall prevent or be deemed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to bring a corresponding action against those Securityholders that such claim alleges have received Merger Consideration or Option Merger Consideration in excess of that to which they are entitled, and to assert as damages against such Securityholders, all losses of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (including reasonable attorney’s fees) resulting from such claim, including seeking equitable contribution on the basis of unjust enrichment or other equitable relief.

     Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses indemnifiable under this Article X. For purposes of the determination of whether such efforts are commercially reasonable, such determination shall be made without regard to Parent’s indemnification rights hereunder.

57





 





     (b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the Expiration Date (the “Escrow Period”); provided that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or some portion thereof) that is necessary, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and subject to the objection of the Securityholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 10.02(g) hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied Losses concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of the Escrow Period specified in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the Escrow Period. As soon as any such Loss has been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Securityholders the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy any other such unresolved Loss. Deliveries of amounts from the Escrow Fund to the Securityholders pursuant to this Section 10.02(b) shall be made in their respective Pro Rata Share of the amount being distributed from the Escrow Fund, provided that Parent may elect, in its discretion, to pay all Option Holders directly.

     (c) Securityholder Agent of the Securityholders; Power of Attorney. In the event that this Agreement is approved and adopted by the Company’s shareholders, effective upon such consent, and without further act of any Shareholder or Option Holder, David R. Scholl, Ph.D., shall be appointed as the Securityholder Agent for each Securityholder, for and on behalf of all Securityholders, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of amounts from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such deliveries, to agree to negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. In the event that David R. Scholl, Ph.D. resigns as Securityholder Agent or otherwise ceases or is unable to serve in that capacity, Summit Accelerator Fund, L.P shall be automatically appointed as Securityholder Agent. The Securityholder Agent may be changed by the Securityholders from time to time upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice to Parent; provided that the Securityholder Agent may not be removed unless holders of a majority interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the position of Securityholder Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Securityholder Agent, and the Securityholder Agent shall not receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the Securityholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the Securityholders.

     (d) Protection of Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall hold and invest the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

     (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Expiration Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an “Officer’s Certificate”): (A) stating that Parent has incurred, paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to incur, pay or accrue Losses, and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was incurred, paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant or other claim to which such

58





 





item is related and to the extent known a reasonable summary of the facts underlying the claim, and if no objection is received from the Securityholder Agent in accordance with Section 10.02(f), the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 10.02(f) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, an amount equal to such Losses. If any Losses cannot be quantified with specificity at the time of sending the Officer’s Certificate, Parent shall deliver a supplement to such Officer’s Certificate as soon as practicable after such amount is or can be determined (and such supplement shall be deemed delivered as of the date of the original Officer’s Certificate relating to such claim).

     (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any Officer’s Certificate (or supplement thereto) to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Securityholder Agent and for a period of 30 days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any amounts from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 10.02(e) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Securityholder Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such 30 day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of an amount from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 10.02(e) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be made on such claim if the Securityholder Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer’s Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such 30-day period.

     (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

          (i) In case the Securityholder Agent shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer’s Certificate, the Securityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims in the Officer’s Certificate. If the Securityholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute the specified amount from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

          (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation or the parties fail to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days of the date of an objection to the Officer’s Certificate, either Parent or the Securityholder Agent may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. Any matter submitted to arbitration pursuant to this Section 10.02 of this Agreement shall be conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator in accordance with the then-current JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or, if applicable, the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as applicable. The arbitration shall take place in Dover, Delaware, before a sole arbitrator; provided, however, if the claim exceeds $500,000, exclusive of interest and attorneys’ fees and other fees and costs, the dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators as provided herein. In the event that the arbitration is to be conducted by three arbitrators, Parent and the Securityholder Agent shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. In all cases, each arbitrator shall be independent, be a retired or former district court or appellate court judge of any United States District Court or United States Court of Appeals, and have at least ten years relevant experience.

59





 





The arbitration shall be conducted within a reasonable, limited time frame and designed to minimize the scope, cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties a reasonable opportunity to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators in the case of three arbitrators or the sole arbitrator, as applicable, as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer’s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Securityholders, and notwithstanding anything in Section 10.02(f) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). As to any disputed claim, the arbitrator(s) shall not award less than any amount of Losses conceded by the Securityholder Agent as being properly payable from the Escrow Fund nor any amount in excess of the total Losses sought by Parent in the proceeding, exclusive of interest, fees and costs as applicable (which may be awarded to Parent in addition to the total Losses sought by Parent in the proceeding), and shall in no event award punitive or exemplary damages.

          (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) pursuant to this Section 10.02 may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

          (iv) The prevailing party in any arbitration under this Section 10.02 shall be entitled to recover its fees and costs incurred in the arbitration or proceeding (including attorneys and arbitration fees and costs) from the non-prevailing party and such costs shall be part of the arbitrator(s) decision. In the absence of a determination of the prevailing party, in the event of three arbitrators, each party shall pay for the fees and costs of its selected arbitrator, and (other than required filing fees or sanctions) the remaining fees and costs of the arbitration and arbitrators shall be shared one-half by Parent and one-half by the Securityholders. Fees and costs to be paid by Securityholders shall be paid from the Securityholders’ Fund, and if such Fund shall be insufficient to pay such fees and costs owed by the Securityholders in full, may, in the discretion of Parent, be paid from the Escrow Fund.

          (h) Third-Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim that Parent believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall notify the Securityholder Agent of such claim, and the Securityholder Agent, as representative for the Securityholders, shall be entitled, at the expense of the Securityholders, to participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right, upon the consent of the Securityholder Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to settle any such claim and, to the extent such Losses are subject to indemnification under this Article X, be indemnified for such settlement amount and all related costs and expenses from the Escrow Fund. In the event of any settlement without the consent of the Securityholder Agent, the Securityholders shall not have any liability for Losses from such settlement, and no information relating to the settlement may be introduced in any arbitration proceeding.

ARTICLE XI.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

     Section 11.01 Actions and Liability of the Securityholder Agent.

          (a) Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all Securityholders, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the Securityholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Securityholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholder Agent.

          (b) The Securityholder Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agent while acting in good faith. The Securityholders shall severally indemnify, on the basis of each such holder’s Pro Rata Share, the Securityholder Agent and hold the Securityholder Agent harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without reckless or intentional misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Securityholder Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Agent’s duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder Agent.

     Section 11.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party (including, for this purpose, any Securityholder). Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, provided that the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party (including, for this purpose, any Securityholder), the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

     Section 11.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
