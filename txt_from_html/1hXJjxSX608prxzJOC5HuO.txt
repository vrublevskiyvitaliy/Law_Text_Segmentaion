     Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided
for in this Indenture (other than annual certificates provided pursuant to Section 11.08) shall
include:


     (1) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or opinion has read such
covenant or condition and the definitions herein relating thereto;


     (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation
upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;


     (3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such individual, he has made such
examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as
to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and


     (4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such individual, such condition
or covenant has been complied with.


SECTION 1.03 Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.


     In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion
of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by
the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document,
but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more
other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to
such matters in one or several documents.


     Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to
legal matters, upon a certificate or Opinion of Counsel, or representations by counsel, unless such
officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion
or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are
erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel or representation by counsel may be based,
insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by,
an officer or officers of the Issuer stating that the information with respect to such factual
matters is in the possession of the Issuer, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to
such matters are erroneous.


     Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests,
consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may,
but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.


SECTION 1.04 Acts of Holders.


     (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one
or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent
duly appointed in writing or by the record of the Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of
such Holders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Fifteen; and, except
as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or
instruments or any such record is delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly
required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments or such record (and the action embodied
therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the Act of the Holders signing
such instrument or instruments or voting at such meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument
or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and
conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer if made in the manner provided in this Section.
The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in
Section 15.07 and the record so proved shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and
conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section.


     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may
be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or
other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds,
certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution
thereof, or may be proved in such other manner as shall be deemed sufficient by the Trustee. Where
such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date
of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the
same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.


     (c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.


     (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of
the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of
every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Issuer in
reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.


     (e) The Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, may set a date for the purpose of determining
the Holders of Securities entitled to consent, vote or take any other action referred to in this
Section 1.04, which date shall be not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the taking
of the consent, vote or other action.


SECTION 1.05 Notices, etc. to Trustee and Issuer.


     Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of the Holders
or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to,
or filed with,


     (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose
hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office and, unless otherwise herein expressly provided, any such document
shall be deemed to be sufficiently made, given, furnished or filed upon its receipt by a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee, or


     (2) the Issuer by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose
hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to the Issuer addressed to it at:





[To
be provided]





or at any other address or addresses previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the
Issuer.


SECTION 1.06 Notice to Holders; Waiver.


     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in
the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date,
prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail,
neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this
Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person
entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the
equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such
filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver.


     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it
shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with
the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.


SECTION 1.07 Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.


     If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by any of
Sections 310 to 317, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act through operation of Section 318(c),
such imposed duties shall control.


SECTION 1.08 Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.


     The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction hereof.


SECTION 1.09 Successors and Assigns.


     All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Issuer shall bind its successors and
assigns, whether so expressed or not.


SECTION 1.10 Separability Clause.


     In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.


SECTION 1.11 Benefits of Indenture.


     Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person,
other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and the Holders and to the extent
provided in Article Four the holders of Senior Indebtedness, any benefit or any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.


SECTION 1.12 Governing Law; Waiver of Trial by Jury.


     This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York. Each of the Issuer and the Trustee irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Indenture or the transactions contemplated hereby.


SECTION 1.13 Legal Holidays.


     In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any
Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other
provision of this Indenture or of the Securities) payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or
interest, if any, on such Security need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may
be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect
as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided
that no additional interest shall accrue with respect to the payment due on such date for the
period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case
may be.


ARTICLE TWO


SECURITY FORMS


SECTION 2.01 Forms Generally.


     The Securities of each series shall be in substantially the form established from time to time
by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in each case
with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as are required or
permitted by this Indenture, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification
and such legends or endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any
securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such
Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. Any portion of the text of any
Security may be set forth on the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on the face
of the Security. If the form of Securities of any series is established by action taken pursuant to
a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the
delivery of the Issuer Order contemplated by Section 3.03 for the authentication and delivery of
such Securities. Any such Board Resolution or record of such action shall have attached thereto a
true and correct copy of the form of Security referred to therein approved by or pursuant to such
Board Resolution.


     The Trustees certificate of authentication shall be in substantially the form set forth in
this Article.


     The definitive Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on steel engraved borders
or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined by the officers executing such
Securities, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.


SECTION 2.02 Form of Trustees Certificate of Authentication.


     The Trustees certificate of authentication on all Securities shall be in substantially the
following form:


     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein issued under the
within-mentioned Indenture.


SECTION 2.03 Securities in Global Form


     If any Security of a series is issuable in global form (a Global Security), such Global
Security may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities from
time to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding
Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect exchanges. Any
endorsement of a Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount,
of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee and in such manner as
shall be specified in such Global Security. Any instructions by the Issuer with respect to a Global
Security, after its initial issuance, shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 1.02.


     Global Securities may be issued in either temporary or permanent form. Permanent Global
Securities will be issued in definitive form.


ARTICLE THREE


THE SECURITIES


SECTION 3.01 Amount Unlimited; Issuable in Series.


     The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under
this Indenture is unlimited.


     The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant
to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officers Certificate of the Issuer or established in
one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series,


     (1) the title of the Securities of the series (which shall distinguish the Securities
of the series from all other Securities);


     (2) the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series and any limit upon
the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the series which may be authenticated and
delivered under this Indenture (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon

series pursuant to Section 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 10.06 or 12.07);


     (3) the date or dates on which the principal (and premium, if any) of the Securities
of the series is payable or the method of determination thereof;


     (4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable), or the method of determination
thereof, at which the Securities of the series shall bear interest, if any, including the
rate of interest applicable on overdue payments of principal or interest, if different from
the rate of interest stated in the title of the Security, the date or dates from which such
interest shall accrue or the method of determination thereof, the Interest Payment Dates on
which such interest shall be payable and the Regular Record Date for the interest payable on
any Interest Payment Date;


     (5) the Paying Agent or Paying Agents for the Securities of the series if other than
the Trustee;


     (6) the Place of Payment of the Securities of the series;


     (7) if other than U.S. Dollars, the foreign currency or currencies in which Securities
of the series shall be denominated or in which payment of the principal of (and premium, if
any) or interest on Securities of the series may be made, and the particular provisions
applicable thereto and, if applicable, the amount of the Securities of the series which
entitles the Holder of a Security of the series or its proxy to one vote for purposes of
Section 15.06;


     (8) the right, if any, of the Issuer to redeem the Securities of such series and the
period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions
upon which Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of
the Issuer;


     (9) the obligation, if any, of the Issuer to redeem or purchase Securities of the
series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions or at the option of a Holder
thereof and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which
and the terms and conditions upon which Securities of the series shall be redeemed or
purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation;


     (10) if other than denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, the
denominations in which Securities of the series shall be issuable;


     (11) whether the Securities of the series shall be issued in whole or in part in the
form of one or more Global Securities and, in such case, the depository (the Depository)
for such Global Security or Securities; and the manner in which and the circumstances under
which Global Securities representing Securities of the series may be exchanged for Securities
in definitive form, if other than, or in addition to, the manner and circumstances specified
in Section 3.05(b);


     (12) if other than the principal amount thereof, the portion of the principal amount of
Securities of the series which shall be payable upon declaration of acceleration of the
Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 6.02;


     (13) if the provisions of Section 5.02 of this Indenture are to apply to the Securities
of the series, a statement indicating the same;


     (14) any deletions from or modifications of or additions to the Events of Default set
forth in Section 6.01 pertaining to the Securities of the series;


     (15) the form of the Securities of the series;


     (16) the Reporting Date of the Securities of the series; and


     (17) any other terms of a particular series and any other provisions expressing or
referring to the terms and conditions upon which the Securities of that series are to be
issued, which terms and provisions are not in conflict with the provisions of this Indenture
or do not adversely affect the rights of Holders of any other series of Securities then
Outstanding); provided, however, that the addition to or subtraction from or variation of
Articles Four, Five, Six, Nine, Eleven, Thirteen and Sixteen (and Section 1.01 insofar as it
relates to the definition of certain terms as used in such


Articles) with regard to the Securities of a particular series shall not be deemed to
constitute a conflict with the provisions of those Articles.


     All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination
and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution and set forth in
such Officers Certificate or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one
series need not be issued at the same time, and unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened
for issuance of additional Securities of such series without the consent of the Holders thereof.


     Except as modified in a Board Resolution, Officers Certificate or supplemental indenture
establishing a series of Securities, the Securities shall be subordinated in right of payment to
Senior Indebtedness as provided in Article Four. The Securities of all series shall rank on a
parity in right of payment.


     If any of the terms of the series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board
Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or
an Assistant Secretary of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of
the Officers Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.


SECTION 3.02 Denominations.


     The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons in such
denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. In the absence of any such
provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be
issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.


SECTION 3.03 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.


     The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by its Chairman of the Board, its
President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by
its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the
Securities may be manual or facsimile.


     Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the
proper officers of the Issuer shall bind such Person notwithstanding that such individuals or any
of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such
Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of issuance of such Securities.


     At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the
Issuer may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Issuer to the Trustee for
authentication, together with an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of such
Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Issuer Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Securities. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Security, then, for purposes
of this Section and Section 3.04, the notation of a beneficial owners interest therein upon
original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security
shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owners
interest in such permanent Global Security.


     In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this
Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to
Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon the documents specified in Section 314 of
the Trust Indenture Act, and, in addition:


     (1) a Board Resolution relating thereto, and if applicable, an appropriate record of
any action taken pursuant to such Board Resolution, certified by the Secretary or Assistant
Secretary of the Issuer, if applicable;


     (2) an executed supplemental indenture, if any; and


     (3) an Opinion of Counsel which shall state:


     (A) that the form and terms of such Securities have been established by or
pursuant to Board Resolutions, by a supplemental indenture or by both such resolution
or resolutions and such supplemental indenture in conformity with the provisions of
this Indenture;


     (B) that the supplemental indenture, if any, when executed and delivered by the
Issuer and the Trustee, will constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the
Issuer; and


     (C) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and
issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such
Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the
Issuer, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights and to general equity principles, and will be
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.


If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate
such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the
Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in
a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.


     Nothwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of this Section 3.03, if all Securities of
a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the
Board Resolution and the Officers Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or the
Board Resolution and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 3.03 at or
prior to the time of authentication of each Security of such series, if such documents are
delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such
series to be issued.


     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.


     No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory
for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially
in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate
upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.


SECTION 3.04 Temporary Securities.


     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Issuer may execute, and
upon Issuer Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are
printed, lithographed, typewritten, reproduced or otherwise produced, in any authorized
denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are
issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the
officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such
Securities.


     If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Issuer will cause definitive Securities
of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive
Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for
definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at
the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the
Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the
Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like
principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so
exchanged the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.


SECTION 3.05 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange Global Securities Representing the Securities.


     (a) The Issuer shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a
register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Issuer in
a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the Security Register) in which, subject
to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Issuer shall provide for the registration
of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed Security Registrar
for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.


     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or
agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new
Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount and Stated Maturity.


     Except as otherwise provided in this Article Three, at the option of the Holder, Securities of
any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be
exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the
Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the
Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.


     All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the
valid obligations of the Issuer evidencing the same debt and entitled to the same benefits under
this Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.


     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if
so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed,
by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing with such signature guaranteed by
a commercial bank reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or by a member of a national securities
exchange.


     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities,
but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 10.06 or 12.07 not involving any
transfer.


     The Issuer shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities
of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under
Section 12.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register
the transfer of or exchange of any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except
the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.


     (b) If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a series
are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Issuer
shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 3.03 and the Issuer Order with
respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in temporary or
permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by one or
more Global Securities, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global
Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee
or delivered or held pursuant to such Depositarys instruction, and (iv) unless otherwise provided
for, the Securities of such series pursuant to Section 3.01, shall bear a legend substantially to
the following effect: This Security may not be


transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of
the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any
such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary, unless and until
this Security is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form.


     Each Depositary designated pursuant to Section 3.01 must, at the time of its designation and
at all times while it serves as Depositary, be a clearing agency registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and any other applicable statute or
regulation.


     If at any time the Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Issuer that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time
the Depositary for Securities of a series shall no longer be a clearing agency registered and in
good standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation (as required by this
Section 3.05), the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under this Section 3.05
with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor Depositary for the Securities of such
series is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or
becomes aware of such condition, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will
authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series
in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.


     The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any
series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such
Global Security or Securities. In such event, the Issuer shall execute, and the
Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive
Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive
form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or
Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.


     If the Securities of any series shall have been issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities and if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Issuer may, and upon the request of the Trustee shall, promptly
execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of
definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in
definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global
Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.


     The Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series
of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in definitive form on
such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge:


     (i) to each Person specified by the Depositary a new Security or Securities of the
same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Persons beneficial interest in the Global
Security; and


     (ii) to the Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the
difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the
aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to holders thereof.


     Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security
shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to
this subsection (b) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the
Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect
participants or


otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in
whose names such Securities are so registered.


SECTION 3.06 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.


     If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Issuer shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and
of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.


     If there shall be delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction
of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be
required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the
absence of notice to the Issuer or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected
purchaser, the Issuer shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series
and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.


     If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due
and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such
Security.


     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Issuer may require the payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected
therewith.


     Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed,
lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the
Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time


     enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.


     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all
other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Securities.


SECTION 3.07 Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.


     Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any
Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest.


     At the option of the Issuer, interest on the Securities of any series that bear interest may
be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall
appear in the Security Register.


     Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (Defaulted Interest) shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and
such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Issuer, at its election in each case, as provided in
clause (1) or (2) below:


     (1) The Issuer may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in
whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Issuer shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security
of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of


money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest
or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of
the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee
shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not
more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not
less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The
Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at
the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security
Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so
mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of
such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following
clause (2).


     (2) The Issuer may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any
series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by
such exchange, if, after notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee of the proposed payment
pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.


     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this
Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security
shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
other Security.


SECTION 3.08 Persons Deemed Owners.


     Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee
and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is
registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on such Security and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any
agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.


SECTION 3.09 Cancellation.


     All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, conversion, registration of transfer or
exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment or analogous obligation shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and promptly shall be
cancelled by it and, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Issuer
may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Issuer may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities
so delivered promptly shall be cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in
lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as
expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be
disposed of in accordance with the Trustees customary procedures unless directed by an Issuer
Order. The acquisition of any Securities by the Issuer shall not operate as a redemption or
satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented thereby unless and until such Securities are
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. Permanent Global Securities shall not be destroyed
until exchanged in full for definitive Securities or until payment thereon is made in full.


SECTION 3.10 Computation of Interest.


     Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any series,
interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a year of twelve 30-day
months.


SECTION 3.11 CUSIP Numbers.


     The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use CUSIP numbers (if then generally in use), and,
if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of
such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and
that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and
any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer
will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers.


ARTICLE FOUR


SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES


SECTION 4.01 Agreement To Subordinate.


     The Issuer agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Security of any series agrees, that the
Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in
the manner provided in this Article Four, to the prior payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents
of all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and that the subordination is for the benefit of and
enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Securities shall in all respects rank
pari passu with all other Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer; and only Indebtedness of the
Issuer that is Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance
with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Four shall be subject to
Section 4.12.


SECTION 4.02 Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy.


     Upon any distribution to creditors of the Issuer in a liquidation or dissolution of the Issuer
or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the
Issuer or its property, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the
Issuers assets and liabilities, the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive
payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents of such Senior Indebtedness and all outstanding Letter
of Credit Obligations shall be fully cash collateralized before the Holders shall be entitled to
receive any payment with respect to the Securities, and until all Senior Indebtedness is paid in
full in cash or Cash Equivalents, any distribution to which the Holders would be entitled shall be
made to the holders of Senior Indebtedness (except that Holders may receive (i) shares of stock and
any debt securities that are subordinated at least to the same extent as the Securities to (a)
Senior Indebtedness and (b) any securities issued in exchange for Senior Indebtedness and (ii)
payments and other distributions made from the trusts described in Section 5.01).


SECTION 4.03 Default on Senior Indebtedness.


     The Issuer shall not make any payment upon or in respect of the Securities (except that
Holders may receive (i) shares of stock and any debt securities that are subordinated at least to
the same extent as the Securities to (a) Senior Indebtedness and (b) any securities issued in
exchange for Senior Indebtedness and (ii) payments and other distributions made from the trusts
described in Section 5.01) until all Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash or Cash
Equivalents if (i) a default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on,
or of unreimbursed amounts under drawn letters of credit or in respect of bankers acceptances or
fees relating to letters of credit or bankers acceptances constituting, Designated Senior
Indebtedness occurs and is continuing beyond any


applicable period of grace in the indenture, agreement or other document governing such Designated
Senior Indebtedness (a Payment Default) or (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with
respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness that permits holders of the Designated Senior
Indebtedness as to which such default relates to accelerate its maturity without further notice
(except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any
applicable grace periods (a Non-Payment Default) and the Trustee receives a notice of such
default (a Payment Blockage Notice) from a representative of holders of such Designated Senior
Indebtedness. Payments on the Securities, including any missed payments, may and shall be resumed
(a) in the case of a Payment Default, upon the date on which such default is cured or waived or
shall have ceased to exist or such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have been discharged or
paid in full in cash or Cash Equivalents and all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations shall
have been fully cash collateralized and (b) in case of a Non-Payment Default, the earlier of (x)
the date on which such nonpayment default is cured or waived, (y) 179 days after the date on which
the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received (each such period, the Payment Blockage
Period) or (z) the date such Payment Blockage Period shall be terminated by written notice to the
Trustee from the requisite holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness necessary to terminate
such period or from their representative. No new Payment Blockage Period may be commenced unless
and until 365 days have elapsed since the effectiveness of the immediately preceding Payment
Blockage Notice. However, if any Payment Blockage Notice within such 365-day period is given by or
on behalf of any holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness (other than the agent under the Senior
Credit Facilities), the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Payment Blockage
Notice within such period. In no event, however, shall the total number of days during which any
Payment Blockage Period or Periods is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any 365
consecutive day period. No Non-Payment Default that existed or was continuing on the date of
delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a
subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default shall have been cured or waived for a period
of not less than 90 days.


SECTION 4.04 Acceleration of Payment of Securities.


     If payment of the Securities of any series is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the
Issuer or the Trustee shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness (or
their Representative) of the acceleration. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness is outstanding,
the Issuer shall not pay the Securities until five Business Days after such holders or the
Representative of
the Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, shall pay
the Securities only if this Article Four otherwise permits payment at that time.


SECTION 4.05 When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.


     If a distribution is made to Holders that because of this Article Four should not have been
made to them, the Holders who receive the distribution shall hold it in trust for holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.


SECTION 4.06 Subrogation.


     After all Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer is paid in full and until the Securities are paid
in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to
receive distributions applicable to Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article
Four to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not,
as between the Issuer and Holders, a payment by the Issuer on such Senior Indebtedness.


SECTION 4.07 Relative Rights.


     This Article Four defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer. Nothing in this Indenture shall:


     (1) impair, as between the Issuer and Holders, the obligation of the Issuer, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on and liquidated damages in
respect of, the Securities in accordance with their terms; or


     (2) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer to receive distributions otherwise payable to Holders.


SECTION 4.08 Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Issuer.


     No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to enforce the subordination of
the Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the
Issuer or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.


SECTION 4.09 Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.


     Notwithstanding Section 4.03, the Trustee or Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the
Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit
the making of any such payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such
payment, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to it that payments may
not be made under this Article Four. The Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative
or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer may give the notice; provided, however, that, if
an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer has a Representative, only the Representative may
give the notice.


     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Registrar and the Paying Agent may
do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this
Article Four with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer which may at any time be held by
it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article
Seven shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Four
shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07.


SECTION 4.10 Distribution or Notice to Representative.


     Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the Issuer, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any).


SECTION 4.11 Article Four Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate.


     The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in this
Article Four shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default. Nothing in
this Article Four shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate
the maturity of the Securities.


SECTION 4.12 Trust Moneys Not Subordinated.


     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds
of Government Securities held in trust under Article Five by the Trustee for the payment of
principal of and interest on the Securities shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any
Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Four,
and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Issuer or any holder
of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any other creditor of the Issuer.


SECTION 4.13 Trustee Entitled to Rely.


     Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Four, the Trustee and the Holders
shall be entitled to rely (i) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in
which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 4.02 are pending, (ii) upon a
certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution
to the Trustee or to the Holders or (iii) upon the Representatives for the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in
such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the
Issuer, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Four. In the event that the Trustee
determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a
holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant
to this Article Four, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the
extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other
facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Four, and, if such evidence is not
furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to
the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Sections 7.01 and 7.03 shall be
applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Four.


SECTION 4.14 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.


     Each Holder by accepting a Security of any series authorizes and directs the Trustee on his
behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the
subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer as provided
in this Article Four and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.


SECTION 4.15 Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness.


     The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay
over or distribute to Holders or the Issuer or any other Person, money or assets to which any
holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Four or
otherwise.


SECTION 4.16 Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness on Subordination Provisions.


     (a) Each Holder by accepting a Security of any series acknowledges and agrees that the
foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration
to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, whether such Senior Indebtedness was
created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to
hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness
shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and
continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.


     (b) Without in any way limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this Section, the holders
of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to
the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Holders and without impairing
or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Four or the obligations hereunder of the
Holders to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (1) change the
manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness
is outstanding; (2) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged
or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness; (3) release any Person liable in any manner for the
collection of Senior


Indebtedness; and (4) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Issuer or any
other Person.


SECTION 4.17 Trustees Compensation Not Prejudiced.


     Nothing in this Article Four shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections of this Indenture.


SECTION 4.18 Defeasance.


     The terms of this Article Four shall not apply to payments from money or the proceeds of U.S.
Government Securities held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Securities pursuant to the provisions described in Section 5.03.


ARTICLE FIVE


SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE; DEFEASANCE


SECTION 5.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Securities of any Series.


     The Issuer shall be deemed to have satisfied and discharged the entire Indebtedness on all the
Securities of any particular series (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer
or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, upon Issuer Request and
at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute such instruments as may be requested by the Issuer
acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of such Indebtedness, when


     (a) either


     (1) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities
which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in
Section 3.06 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in
trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or
discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 11.03) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or


     (2) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation


     (A) have become due and payable, or


     (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or


     (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in
the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer,


and the Issuer, in the case of (A), (B) or (C) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited
with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (other than Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which
have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06), for principal (and premium, if any)
and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and
payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;


     (b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Issuer;
and


     (c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the entire Indebtedness on all Securities of such series have been
complied with.


     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the
Issuer to the Trustee under Section 7.07 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee
pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (2) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under
Section 5.03 and the last paragraph of Section 11.03 shall survive.


SECTION 5.02 Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.


     The Issuer may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a supplemental indenture
or, at any time, by a Board Resolution set forth in an Officers Certificate with respect to the
Securities of any series, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to a
particular series of Securities, elect to have either Section 5.03 or 5.04 be applied to all of the
Outstanding Securities of that series upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this
Article Five.


SECTION 5.03 Legal Defeasance and Discharge.


     Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 5.02 of the option applicable to this Section 5.03,
the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all
Outstanding Securities of the particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date
the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, Legal Defeasance). For this purpose,
such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged all the
obligations relating to the Outstanding Securities of that series, including any coupons
appertaining thereto, and the Securities of that series, including any coupons appertaining
thereto, shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding only for the purposes of Section 5.06 and
the other Sections of this Indenture referred to below in this Section 5.03, and to have satisfied
all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this
Indenture and cured all then existing Events of Default (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the
expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the
following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (i) the Issuers
obligations with respect to Securities of such series under Sections 3.05, 3.06, 11.02 and 11.03,
(ii) rights of Holders to receive payments of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest,
if any, on the Securities of such series as they shall become due from time to time and other
rights, duties and obligations of Holders as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts so
deposited with the Trustee, (iii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder
(for which purposes the
Securities of such series shall be deemed outstanding), (iv) this Article Five and the obligations
set forth in Section 5.06 hereof and (v) the obligations of the Issuer under Section 7.07 hereof.


     Subject to compliance with this Article Five, the Issuer may exercise its option under Section
5.03 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 5.04 with respect to the
Securities of a particular series and any coupons appertaining thereto.


SECTION 5.04 Covenant Defeasance.


     Upon the Issuers exercise under Section 5.02 of the option applicable to this Section 5.04,
the Issuer shall be released from any obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 9.01,
11.04, 11.05, 11.06, 11.08 and 11.09 hereof or established pursuant to Sections 3.01 or 10.01
hereof with respect to the Outstanding Securities of the particular series on and after the date
the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, Covenant Defeasance), and the
Securities of that series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed not
Outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders
(and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be
deemed Outstanding for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Securities
shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, such Covenant
Defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of that series and any coupons
appertaining thereto, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of
any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly,
by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by


reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document
and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or Event of Default under Section
6.01(4) or any Event of Default specified pursuant to Section 3.01 or 10.01 but, except as
specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be
unaffected thereby.


SECTION 5.05 Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.


     The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section 5.03 or Section
5.04 to the Outstanding Securities of a particular series:


     (a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the
Trustee for the Securities of that series, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the
Securities of that series, cash in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of that
series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of
that series), U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be
sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if any, due on the outstanding
Securities of that series and any related coupons at the Stated Maturity, or on the applicable
Redemption Date, as the case may be, with respect to the outstanding Securities of that series and
any related coupons;


     (b) in the case of Legal Defeasance only, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee for
the Securities of that series (1) an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, since the date on which Securities of such series were originally
issued, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. Federal income tax law, to the effect that,
and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to customary assumptions and
exclusions, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of that series will not recognize income,
gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred or (2) a copy of a ruling or
other formal statement or action to that effect received from or published by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service;


     (c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance only, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee
for the Securities of that series an Opinion of Counsel confirming that, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of that series will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and
will be subject to such tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;


     (d) no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or
both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series (other than
any event resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to make such deposit) shall have
occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;


     (e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation
of, or constitute a default under any material agreement (other than this Indenture) or instrument
to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound; and


     (f) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee for the Securities of that series an
Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.


     As used in this Article Five, U.S. Government Obligations means securities that are (i)
direct obligations of the United States of America for payment of which its full faith and credit
is pledged or (ii) obligations of a Person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or
instrumentality of the United States of America the timely payment of which is unconditionally
guaranteed as a full faith


and credit obligation of the United States of America, which, in either case under clauses (i) or
(ii), are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and will also include a
depository receipt issued by a bank or trust company as custodian with respect to any such U.S.
Government Obligation or a specified payment of interest on or principal of any such U.S.
Government Obligation held by such custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt,
provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized to make any deduction
from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received by the
custodian in respect of the U.S. Government Obligation or the specific payment of interest on or
principal of the U.S. Government Obligation evidenced by such depository receipt.


SECTION 5.06 Survival of Certain Obligations.


     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of the Securities of a particular series
referred to in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.04, or 5.05, the respective obligations of the Issuer and the
Trustee for the Securities of a particular series under Sections 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 3.09,
5.07, 5.08, 5.09 and 6.08, Article Seven, and Sections 8.01, 8.02, 11.02, 11.03 and 11.04, shall
survive with respect to Securities of that series until the Securities of that series are no longer
outstanding, and thereafter the obligations of the Issuer and the Trustee for the Securities of a
particular series with respect to that series under Sections 5.07, 5.08 and 5.09 shall survive.
Nothing contained in this Article Five shall abrogate any of the obligations or duties of the
Trustee of any series of Securities under this Indenture.


SECTION 5.07 Application of Trust Money.


     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 11.03, all money deposited with the
Trustee pursuant to Sections 5.01 and 5.02 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance
with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for
whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.


SECTION 5.08 Repayment of Moneys Held by Paying Agent.


     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any other Paying Agent remaining unclaimed by the
Holders of any Securities for two years after the date upon which the principal of or interest on
such Securities shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Issuer by the Trustee or
any such other Paying Agent and such Holders shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Issuer
only as general creditors for payment thereof (unless otherwise provided by law); provided,
however, that, before the Trustee or any such other Paying Agent is required to make any such
payment to the Issuer, the Trustee may, upon the written request of the Issuer and at the expense
of the Issuer, cause to be published once in an Authorized Newspaper a notice that such money
remains unclaimed and that, after the date set forth in said notice, the balance of such money then
unclaimed will be returned to the Issuer.


SECTION 5.09 Reinstatement.


     If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with
Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any
order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, the Issuers obligations under this Indenture and the Securities
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Sections 5.01 or
5.02, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee is permitted to apply all such money or
U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be; provided
that, if the Issuer has made payment of principal of, or interest on any Securities because of the
reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of
such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the
Trustee.

any Significant Subsidiary in this Indenture or any Security of that series (other than a
covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this
Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely
for the benefit
of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach
for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
Issuer by the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying
such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a
Notice of Default hereunder; or

of their property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the
continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed
and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or


     (6) the commencement by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of a voluntary case
or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or
insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of

the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing
by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any
applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to
the appointment of or taking possession by a Custodian of the Issuer or any Significant

the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its


debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary in furtherance of any such action, or the taking of any comparable
action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or


     (7) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.


SECTION 6.02 Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.


     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other
than of a type specified in Section 6.01(5) or (6)) occurs and is continuing, then in every such
case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series
are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in
the terms of that series) of all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable
immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and
upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due
and payable, anything in this Indenture or in any of the Securities of such series to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest
on the Securities of such series shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Four.


     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series
has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may
rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if


     (1) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay


     (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,


     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series
which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest
thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,


     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue
interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and


     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof;


and


     (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the
nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 6.13.


No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.


     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under Section
6.01(5) or (6), all outstanding Securities shall IPSO FACTO become due and payable without further
action or notice.


SECTION 6.03 Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.


     The Issuer covenants that if


     (1) default is made in the payment of interest on any Security when such interest
becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days,


     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or, premium, if any, on) any
Security at the Maturity thereof, or


     (3) default is made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund payment or
analogous obligation when the same becomes due pursuant to the terms of any Security,


the Issuer, upon demand of the Trustee, will pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such
Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, including any
sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and, to
the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue
principal (and premium, if any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed
therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient
to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due to the
Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof.


     If the Issuer fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of
the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may
enforce the same against the Issuer or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the
Issuer or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated.


     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall
deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of
any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein,
or to enforce any other proper remedy.


SECTION 6.04 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.


     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the
Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Issuer or of such other
obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective
of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer for the payment of overdue
principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise,


     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other
papers or documents and take such other actions, including participating as a member, voting
or otherwise, of any official committee of creditors appointed in such matter, as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and


     (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any
such claim and to distribute the same;


and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such
payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any
other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.


     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to
or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding except as aforesaid,
to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person or to participate as a
member, voting or otherwise, on any committee of creditors.


SECTION 6.05 Trustee May Enforce Claims without Possession of Securities.


     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and
enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof
in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be
brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after
provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in
respect of which such judgment has been recovered.


SECTION 6.06 Application of Money Collected.


     Subject to the provisions of Article Four, any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this
Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in
case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest,
upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid
and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:


     FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07;


     SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such
money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to
the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and
interest, respectively; and


     THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Issuer, its successors or
assigns, or to whomever may be so lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of
competent jurisdiction may direct.


SECTION 6.07 Limitation on Suits.


     No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless


     (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing
Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;


     (2) the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute
proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;


     (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against
the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;


     (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of
indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and


     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee
during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series;


it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any
manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb
or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or
preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.


SECTION 6.08 Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.


     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have
the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment (subject to the provisions of
Article Four) of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.07) interest on
such Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.


SECTION 6.09 Restoration of Rights and Remedies.


     If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy
under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has
been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder,


     then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, the
Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as
though no such proceeding had been instituted.


SECTION 6.10 Rights and Remedies Cumulative.


     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy
herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other
appropriate right or remedy.


SECTION 6.11 Delay or Omission Not Waiver.


     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing
upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law
to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.


SECTION 6.12 Control by Holders.


     The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy


available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect
to the Securities of such series, provided that


     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this
Indenture,


     (2) the Trustee shall not determine that the action so directed would be unjustly
prejudicial to the Holders of the Securities of such series not taking part in such
direction, or to the Holders of the Securities of any other series, and


     (3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not
inconsistent with such direction.


SECTION 6.13 Waiver of Past Defaults.


     Subject to Section 6.02, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such
series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a
default


     (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any
Security of such series, or


     (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Ten cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such
series affected.


     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.


SECTION 6.14 Undertaking for Costs.


     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the
enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit
of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, against any party litigant in such suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party
litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee,
to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10%
in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any
Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on
any Security on or after the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the
case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).


SECTION 6.15 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.


     The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time
insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any
stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully
do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will
not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will
suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.


ARTICLE SEVEN


THE TRUSTEE


SECTION 7.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities.


     (a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,


     (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and


     (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon
certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof
are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty
to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
Indenture but need not verify the accuracy of the contents thereof or whether procedures
specified by or pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture have been followed in the
preparation thereof.


     (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and
skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of such persons own affairs.


     (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability
for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct,
except that


     (1) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of
this Section;


     (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining
the pertinent facts;


     (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, determined as provided in
Section 6.12, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee,
under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series;


     (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable
grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or
liability is not reasonably assured to it; and


     (5) whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture
relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.


SECTION 7.02 Notice of Defaults.


     Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of
any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as
their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, notice of such default hereunder known
to the Trustee,


unless such default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of
a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of
such series or in the payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation installment with respect
to Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so
long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is
in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series; and provided, further, that in the
case of any default of the character specified in Section 6.01(4) with respect to Securities of
such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence
thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term default means any event which is, or after
notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to Securities of
such series.


SECTION 7.03 Certain Rights of Trustee.


     Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01:


     (a) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction,
consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of Indebtedness or other paper or document
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;


     (b) any request or direction of the Issuer mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced
by a Issuer Request or Issuer Order or similar document and any resolution of the Board of
Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;


     (c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable
that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder,
the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers Certificate;


     (d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of
Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this
Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such
request or direction;


     (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters
stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of Indebtedness or other paper or
document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into
such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further
inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the
Issuer, personally or by agent or attorney;


     (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties
hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with
due care by it hereunder;


     (h) the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of any matter unless a
Responsible Officer assigned to and working in the Trustees corporate trust department has actual
knowledge thereof or unless written notice thereof is received by the Trustee at the Corporate
Trust Office and such notice references the Securities generally, the Issuer or this Indenture.
Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to an Event of Default, such reference shall, insofar
as determining


any liability on the part of the Trustee is concerned, be construed to refer only to an Event of
Default of which the Trustee is deemed to have actual knowledge in accordance with this paragraph;


     (i) the permissive right of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any actions
enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty;


     (j) in no event shall the Trustee be liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action; and


     (k) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the
performance of its obligations under this Indenture arising out of or caused by, directly or
indirectly, forces beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation strikes, work
stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural
catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications
or computer (software or hardware) services.


SECTION 7.04 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.


     The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustees certificate of
authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer, and the Trustee assumes no
responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the
use or application by the Issuer of Securities or the proceeds thereof.


SECTION 7.05 May Hold Securities.


     The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Issuer, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to
Sections 7.08 and 7.13, may otherwise deal with the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.


SECTION 7.06 Money Held in Trust.


     Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money
received by it hereunder.


SECTION 7.07 Compensation and Reimbursement.


     The Issuer agrees


     (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services
rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);


     (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its
request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such
expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and


     (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability
or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including
the costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, of defending itself against any
claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
duties hereunder.


     As security for the performance of the obligations of the Issuer under this Section, the
Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by
the Trustee, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of particular Securities.


     If the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of an Event of Default
specified in clause (5) or (6) of Section 6.01, the expenses and the compensation for the services
will be intended to constitute expenses of administration under Bankruptcy Law.


     The provisions of this Section 7.07 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee
and the satisfaction, discharge or termination of this Indenture.


SECTION 7.08 Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.


     The Trustee for the Securities of any series issued hereunder shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act during the period of time provided for
therein. In determining whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest as defined
in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the Securities of any series, there
shall be excluded this Indenture with respect to Securities of any particular series of Securities
other than that series. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission
the application referred to in the second to last paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust
Indenture Act.


SECTION 7.09 Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.


     There shall at all times be a corporate Trustee hereunder which complies with the requirements
of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000, subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and having its
Corporate Trust Office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. If such corporation
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the
manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.


SECTION 7.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.


     (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee
pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 7.11.


     (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series
by giving written notice thereof to the Issuer. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor
Trustee required by Section 7.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 10 days after
the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.


     (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by
Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series,
delivered to the Trustee and to the Issuer.


     (d) If at any time:


     (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 7.08(a) after written request
therefor by the Issuer or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months, or


     (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign
after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any such Holder, or


     (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or
insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public
officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the
purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,


then, in any such case, (i) the Issuer by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee with respect to
all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 6.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all
Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.


     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy
shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with respect to the Securities of one or more
series, the Issuer, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees
with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and
that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular
series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 7.11. If, within one year
after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Issuer
and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 7.11, become the
successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the
successor Trustee appointed by the Issuer. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of any series shall have been so appointed by the Issuer or the Holders and accepted appointment in
the manner required by Section 7.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of
such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such series.


     (f) The Issuer shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with
respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to
the Securities of any series by mailing written notice of such event to all Holders of Securities
of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Each notice shall
include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the
address of its Corporate Trust Office.


SECTION 7.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.


     (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all
Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the
Issuer and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Issuer or the successor
Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring
Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.


     (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the retiring Trustee and each successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture
supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1)
shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to
vest in, each successor


Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such
provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to
which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide
for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being
understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees
co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such
Trustee; and upon execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such
successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the
Issuer or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to
such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect
to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee
relates.


     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all
instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all
rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.


     (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance
such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.


SECTION 7.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.


     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the
corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided
such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In
case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in
office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may
adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if
such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.


SECTION 7.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Issuer.


     The Trustee is subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor
relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or
been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent indicated
therein.

COVENANTS


SECTION 11.01 Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.


     The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of each series
that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any,
on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities of that series and
this Indenture.


SECTION 11.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency.


     The Issuer will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or
agency where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer and
exchange, where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities of that
series and this Indenture may be served and where the Securities may be presented for payment. The
Issuer will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the
location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such
required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office
of the Trustee, and the Issuer hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.


     The Issuer may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where
the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes
and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or
rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of its obligation to maintain an office or agency
in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Issuer will give
prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency.


SECTION 11.03 Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.


     If the Issuer shall at any time act as Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities,
it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any,
on the Securities of that series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled


thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will
promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act or of any failure by the Issuer (or
by any other obligor on the Securities of that series) to make any payment of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due
and payable.


     Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it
will, at or prior to the opening of business on each due date of the principal of (and premium, if
any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to
pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held
in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal (and premium, if any) or
interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee
of its action or failure so to act.


     If the Issuer shall appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee for any series of
Securities, it will cause such Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section,
that such Paying Agent will:


     (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any)

the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if

of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.

respect to one or more or all series of Securities hereunder or for any other reason, pay or by
Issuer Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such
series by the Issuer or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts
as those upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment
by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability
with respect to such money.


     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer in trust
for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series
and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has
become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on Issuer Request subject to applicable
abandoned property and escheat law, or (if then held by the Issuer) shall be discharged from such
trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon
cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any
such repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published once a week for two
consecutive weeks (in each case on any day of the week) in an Authorized Newspaper notice that such
money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30

governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Issuer or any such Significant Subsidiary or upon
the income, profits or property of the Issuer or any such Significant Subsidiary, and (2) all
lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon
the property of the Issuer or any such Significant Subsidiary; provided, however, that none of the
Issuer nor any Significant Subsidiary shall be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.

the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Issuer from discontinuing the operation or
maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Issuer
desirable in the conduct of its business and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the
Holders of the Securities of any series.


SECTION 11.07 Waiver of Certain Covenants.


     The Issuer may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition
set forth in Sections 11.04, 11.05 and 11.06 or established pursuant to Section 3.01 or 10.01, with
respect to the Securities of any series, if before the time for such compliance the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of
such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such
term, provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or
condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective,
the obligations of the Issuer and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision
or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

principal accounting officer of the Issuer, covering the period from the date of issuance of such

with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934; or, if the Issuer is not required to file information, documents or reports pursuant to
either of said Sections, then it shall file with the Trustee and the Commission, in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed from time to time by the Commission, such of

from time to time by the Commission.


     Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational
purposes only the Trustees receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the
Issuers or the Parent Guarantors compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers Certificates).


SECTION 11.10 Further Assurances.

In case of any redemption at the election of the Issuer of less than all the Securities of any
series, the Issuer shall, at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Issuer (unless
a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date
and of the principal


amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities
prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such
Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers
Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.


SECTION 12.03 Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.


     If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to
be redeemed shall be selected not more than 45 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee,
from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method
as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for
redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series
or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a
denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series;
provided, however, that Securities of such series registered in the name of the Issuer shall be
excluded from any such selection for redemption until all Securities of such series not so
registered shall have been previously selected for redemption.


     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities selected for
redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed.


     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions
relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to
be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been

identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the
particular Securities to be redeemed,


     (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon
each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to
accrue on and after said date,


     (5) that interest, if any, accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as
specified in said notice,


     (6) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the
Redemption Price, and


     (7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.


     Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Issuer shall be given
by the Issuer or, at the Issuers request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the
Issuer.


SECTION 12.05 Deposit of Redemption Price.


     On or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on any Redemption Date, the Issuer shall deposit
with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Issuer is acting as Paying Agent, segregate and
hold in trust as provided in Section 11.03) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption
Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest
on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.


SECTION 12.06 Securities Payable on Redemption Date.


     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall,
on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from
and after such date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and
accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security
for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Issuer at the
Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that
installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be
payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as
such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 3.07.


     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for
redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the
Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.


SECTION 12.07 Securities Redeemed in Part.


     Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment
therefor (with, if the Issuer or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly
executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Issuer shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without
service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as
requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed
portion of the principal of the security so surrendered. Securities in denominations larger than
$1,000 may be redeemed in part, but only in whole multiples of $1,000.


SECTION 12.08 Securities No Longer Outstanding After Notice to Trustee and Deposit of Cash.


     If the Issuer, having given notice to the Trustee as provided in Section 12.02, shall have
deposited with the Trustee or a Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of any Securities of
any series or portions thereof called for redemption in whole or in part cash or other form of
payment if permitted by the terms of such Securities (which amount shall be immediately due and
payable to the Holders of such Securities or portions thereof), in the amount necessary so to
redeem all such Securities or portions thereof on the Redemption Date and provision satisfactory to
the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of notice of such redemption, such Securities or
portions thereof, shall thereupon, for all purposes of this Indenture, be deemed to be no longer
Outstanding, and the Holders thereof shall be entitled to no rights thereunder or hereunder, except
the right to receive payment of the Redemption Price, together with interest accrued to the
Redemption Date, on or after the Redemption Date of such Securities or portions thereof.

respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such
Securities as provided for by the terms of such series; provided that such Securities have not been
previously so credited pursuant to the terms of such Securities. Such Securities shall be received

for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment
shall be reduced accordingly.

authorized in Section 15.01 by written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action
proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not have mailed or made the first
publication of the notice of such meeting within 30 days after receipt of such request, then the

SECTION 15.05 Quorum; Adjourned Meetings.


     At any meeting of Holders, the presence of Persons holding or representing Securities in an
aggregate principal amount sufficient to take action on the business for the transaction of which
such meeting was called shall be necessary to constitute a quorum. No business shall be transacted
in the absence of a quorum unless a quorum is represented when the meeting is called to order. In
the absence of a quorum within 30 minutes of the time appointed for any such meeting, the meeting
shall, if convened at the request of the Holders of Securities (as provided in Section 15.03), be
dissolved. In any other case the Persons holding or representing a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities represented at the meeting may adjourn such a meeting for a period of not
less than 10 days with the same effect, for all intents and purposes, as though a quorum had been
present. In the absence of a quorum at any such adjourned meeting, such adjourned meeting may be
similarly further adjourned for a period of not less than 10 days. Notice of the reconvening of any
adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section 15.02 except that, in the case of
publication, such notice need be published only once but must be given not less than five days

voting only with respect to the matters covered by such instrument in writing.


     Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of the Holders of Securities of any
series duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all Holders of such series of
Securities whether or not present or represented at the meeting.


SECTION 15.06 Regulations.


     Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may make such reasonable
regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of Holders of Securities, in regard to proof
of the holding of Securities and of the appointment of proxies, and in regard to the appointment
and duties


of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of proxies, certificates and other evidence
of the right to vote, and such other matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall
think fit.


     The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a temporary chairman of the meeting,
unless the meeting shall have been called by the Issuer or by Holders of Securities as provided in
Section 15.03, in which case the Issuer or the Holders of Securities calling the meeting, as the
case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A permanent chairman and a
permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by vote of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities represented at the meeting.


     At any meeting each Holder of a Security of a series entitled to vote at such meeting, or
proxy therefor, shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount (in the case of
Original Issue Discount Securities, such principal amount to be determined as provided in the
definition of Outstanding) of Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided,
however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Security challenged
as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not Outstanding. The chairman of
the meeting shall have no right to vote except as a Holder of Securities of such series or proxy
therefor. Any meeting of Holders of Securities duly called pursuant to the provisions of Section
15.02 or 15.03 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time to time, and the meeting may
be held as so adjourned without further notice.


SECTION 15.07 Voting Procedure.


     The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders shall be by written ballot on
which shall be subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities entitled to vote at such
meeting, or proxies therefor, and on which shall be inscribed an identifying number or numbers or
to which shall be attached a list of identifying numbers of the Securities so held or represented
by them. The permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who shall
count all votes cast at the meeting for or
against any resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their verified
written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the
proceedings of each meeting of Holders of Securities shall be prepared by the secretary of the
meeting and there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of votes
on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more Persons having knowledge of the
facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and showing that said notice was mailed or
published as provided in Section 15.02 and, if applicable, Section 15.05. The record shall be
signed and verified by the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the
duplicates shall be delivered to the Issuer and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the
Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting.


     Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein stated.


SECTION 15.08 Written Consent in Lieu of Meetings.


     The written authorization or consent by the Holders of the requisite percentage in aggregate
principal amount of Securities of any series herein provided, entitled to vote at any such meeting,
evidenced as provided in Section 1.04 and filed with the Trustee, shall be effective in lieu of a
meeting of the Holders of Securities of such series, with respect to any matter provided for in
this Article Fifteen.


SECTION 15.09 No Delay of Rights by Meeting.


     Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed or construed to authorize or permit, by
reason of any call of a meeting of Holders of Securities of any or all series or any rights
expressly or impliedly conferred hereunder to make such call, any hindrance or delay in the
exercise of any right or rights


conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the Holders of Securities of any or all such series
under any provisions of this Indenture or the Securities.
