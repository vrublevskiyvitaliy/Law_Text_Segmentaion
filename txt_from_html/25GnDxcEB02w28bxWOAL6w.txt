ARTICLE II
PUT RIGHTS


     2.1. Burns Put Right Grants and Mechanics.


          (a) HSI hereby grants to Burns the right (a Burns Put Right), at any time and from
time to time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, to require HSI to purchase all
or any portion of the 205,635.72 BAHHC Common Shares owned by Burns on the
date hereof, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.


          (b) Subject to Sections 2.5(a) through (c), Burns may exercise its Burns Put Right by delivery
of a written Notice (a Put Notice) to HSI, which Put Notice shall state that Burns is
exercising its Burns Put Right to require HSI to purchase the number and type of BAHHC Common
Shares specified in such Put Notice (the Put Securities)
and may, if such Put Notice is being delivered at any time prior to
the first anniversary of the Oak Hill Divestiture Date, state the
minimum number of Put Securities that would be acceptable to Burns
if all such Put Securities are greater than the Annual Burns Put
Limitation Amount.


     2.2. Determination of Fair Market Value. For purposes of calculating Burns Put Price
payable in connection with the exercise of any Burns Put Right, the Fair Market Value shall be
determined as follows:


       (a) Pre-QPO. If the Put Notice is delivered prior to a Qualified Initial Public
Offering, the Burns Put Price payable in connection with the exercise of any Burns Put Right shall
be determined as follows:


     (i) Mutual Agreement. Burns and HSI shall use all reasonable efforts
and negotiate in good faith to agree upon the Fair Market Value. If Burns and HSI
agree upon the Fair Market Value, then, subject to the conditions to closing set
forth in Section 2.4 below, Burns shall sell, transfer and convey, and HSI
shall purchase and accept, the Put Securities free and clear of all Liens at the
Burns Put Closing for the Burns Put Price calculated based on such agreed-upon Fair
Market Value.


     (ii) Dispute Procedures. (1) If Burns and HSI are unable to agree upon
the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) within twenty-one (21)
days of the Put Notice Date, then either party may request, by delivery of a written
Notice to the other party, an independent investment bank retained by the Company,
or, if such investment bank is not acceptable to Burns or HSI, another reputable
independent nationally recognized investment bank as to which HSI and Burns mutually
agree (the Designated Investment Banker), that the Designated Investment
Banker determine the Fair Market Value. If HSI and Burns are unable to agree upon
the selection of the Designated Investment Banker, then each shall select one
nationally recognized investment bank and the Designated Investment Banker shall be
selected by those two investment banks, whose determination of the Designated
Investment Banker will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a
court with jurisdiction thereover. The Designated Investment Banker shall
determine the Fair Market Value, using such method or methods of determining Fair
Market Value as it, in its sole discretion, shall determine; provided,
however, that in determining Fair Market Value, the Designated Investment
Banker shall (A) not include a discount for lack of control, minority interests,
lack of a public market in the Companys securities or leverage levels, block sale
discounts or


otherwise take into account any contractual restrictions on the Companys
ability to operate anywhere in the world or limiting HSIs ability to consummate the
Burns Put Closing (other than as set forth in this Agreement), (B) consider, among
other things, the value that could be realized by a sophisticated seller seeking to
maximize the consideration to be received for the Put Securities, whether through a
private sale of 100% of the Company or a strategic combination or in an Initial
Public Offering (determined on a fully distributed basis) and assuming, for purposes
of the valuation, that the capital stock of the Company is widely held and no one
shareholder holds a control position), without taking into consideration any initial
public offering discount or underwriters discount or any other costs or expenses of
sale, and (C) consider, in addition to any other methods deemed by the Designated
Investment Banker, in its sole discretion, to be customary or appropriate, the
Enterprise Value Methodology. For the avoidance of doubt, the Designated
Investment Banker shall not consider or attribute any value (or negative value) to
any distribution advances by the Company provided for in Section 6.6(a)(ii) of the
Operating Agreement or tax liabilities relating to the change from the LIFO to the
FIFO inventory accounting method, which is the subject of the last sentence of
Section 4.1 of the Operating Agreement. Upon reasonable notice, the Designated
Investment Banker shall provide each of Burns and HSI the opportunity to make one
presentation (with representatives of the non-presenting party present) of
reasonable length to the Designated Investment Banker regarding their respective
views on the determination of Fair Market Value; provided that any materials
provided by any party to the Designated Investment Banker in connection with such
presentation shall be simultaneously provided to the other party. The Designated
Investment Banker shall issue its determination in writing to Burns and HSI (the
Final Determination) within forty-five (45) days of delivery of the
initial Notice to the Designated Investment Banker requesting such determination and
will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon
which judgment may be entered by a court with jurisdiction thereover.


     (2) Burns shall have fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Final
Determination (the Decision Period) to decide whether to (A) withdraw its
Put Notice or (B) require HSI to purchase the Put Securities indicated in its Put
Notice for a price equal to the Burns Put Price calculated based on the Fair Market
Value set forth in the Final Determination, which decision shall be furnished to HSI
by written Notice delivered prior to the expiration of the Decision Period,
notifying HSI of such decision (the Final Notice). If the Final Notice
indicates that Burns is withdrawing its Put Notice or if Burns fails to deliver a
Final Notice prior to the expiration of the Decision Period, then the Put Notice
shall be deemed to be irrevocably withdrawn and HSI shall not be required to
purchase the Put Securities specified in such Put Notice. Any Put Notice that is
withdrawn pursuant to this Section 2.2(a)(ii)(2) shall continue to be deemed
to have been delivered for purposes of Section 2.5(c).


          (b) Post-QPO. If the Put Notice is delivered after a Qualified Initial Public
Offering: (i) if the BAHHC Common Shares are then listed or quoted on NASDAQ or NYSE,


the Burns Put Price shall be equal to the Market Price, and (ii) if the BAHHC Common Shares
are not then listed or quoted on NASDAQ or NYSE, the Fair Market Value shall be determined in
accordance with Section 2.2(a). In lieu of exercising a Burns Put Right hereunder, Burns
may, subject to any restriction set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement and any applicable
securities law restrictions, sell any or all of their respective BAHHC Common Shares on the open
market pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or the Registration Rights Agreement.


     2.3. Payment of Burns Put Price. The Burns Put Price payable by HSI at the Burns Put
Closing shall be payable in a single cash payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by Burns in writing at least two (2) days prior to the Burns Put Closing.


     2.4. Burns Put Closing; Conditions Precedent. 


          (a) HSI and Burns shall consummate the sale of the Put Shares (the Burns Put
Closing) as soon as reasonably practicable after the delivery of the Final Notice to HSI, but
in no event later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Final Notice (the Burns Put
Closing Date), subject in all respects to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 2.4(b) and 2.4(c).


          (b) HSIs obligations to purchase the Put Securities at a Burns Put Closing shall be expressly
subject to the fulfillment or express written waiver by HSI of the following conditions on or prior
to the applicable Burns Put Closing Date:


     (i) HSI shall have received from Burns certificates or other instruments
representing the Put Securities, together with unit, stock or other appropriate
powers duly endorsed with respect thereto, if applicable, together with and any other documentation
reasonably requested by HSI in order to confirm that such Put Shares, and all rights
in respect thereof (including, without limitation, all economic and voting rights)
are being transferred to HSI free and clear of all Liens.


     (ii) There shall not be any order of any Governmental Authority restraining or
invalidating the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement.


     (iii) The purchase and sale of the Put Securities at the Burns Put Closing
would not violate the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky laws
applicable to Burns, HSI, the Company or the Put Securities.


          (c) Burnss obligations to sell the Put Securities at a Burns Put Closing shall be expressly
subject to the fulfillment or express written waiver by Burns of the following conditions on or
prior to the applicable Burns Put Closing Date:


     (i) HSI shall have paid the Burns Put Price.


     (ii) There shall not be any order of any Governmental Authority restraining or
invalidating the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement.


     (iii) The purchase and sale of the Put Securities at the Burns Put Closing
would not violate the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky laws
applicable to Burns, HSI, the Company or the Put Securities.


          (d) If any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.4(b) and 2.4(c) are not or are not
reasonably expected to be satisfied on the Burns Put Closing Date, HSI and Burns shall cooperate in
good faith to cause such conditions to be satisfied.


     2.5. Additional Terms and Conditions Applicable to Burns Put Rights.


          (a) During any Pre Divestiture Put Year, Burns shall only be permitted to exercise its Burns
Put Right  during the 30-Day True-Up Period.


          (b) In any Put Year, HSI shall not be required to pay, in the aggregate, Burns Put Prices or
acquire, in the aggregate, that number of Put Securities, as applicable, in excess of the
applicable Annual Burns Put Limitation Amount. If the Burns Put Price otherwise payable by HSI, or
the number of Put Securities otherwise to be acquired by HSI, on a Burns Put Closing Date, when
combined with all other Burns Put Prices and Oak Hill Put Prices paid by HSI during the Put Year in
which such Burns Put Closing Date is to occur, would exceed the Annual Burns
Put Limitation Amount, then HSI shall only be obligated to purchase that portion of the Put
Securities so that, when combined with all other Burns Put Prices paid by HSI and Put Securities
acquired by HSI during the Put Year in which such Burns Put Closing Date is to occur (or deemed to
occur), the Annual Burns Put Limitation Amount is not exceeded, and the number of Put Securities to
be acquired on such Burns Put Closing Date shall be reduced accordingly. If Burns exercises its
Burns Put Right during a 30-Day True-Up Period pursuant to sub-section (b) of the definition of 30-Day True-Up Period, then the prior years Annual Burns Put Limitation Amount
shall be applicable; provided, however, that, if Oak Hill delivers an Oak Hill Put Notice following the
delivery of a Put Notice by Burns but prior to the applicable Put Closing therefor, then (x) the Put Closing in
respect of such Put Notice from Burns  shall be delayed so that such Put Closing shall occur
immediately following the applicable Oak Hill Put Closing, (y) the
Fair Market Value or Market Price, as applicable, shall equal the value or price used in connection with the applicable Oak Hill Put
Closing and (z) if, after giving effect to such Oak Hill Put Closing, the number of Put Securities that would be within the applicable Annual
Burns Put Limitation Amount is less than the minimum number specified
in the Put Notice, then Burns may withdraw such Put Notice and the
next Put Notice delivered by Burns during the remainder of such Put
Year shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 2.5(c).


          (c) No Put Notice may be delivered if a Put Notice has already been delivered during the
immediately preceding twelve (12) month period, and any such Put Notice shall be void ab initio;
provided, however, if a Put Notice is withdrawn pursuant to Sections
2.2(a)(ii)(2) then Burns may deliver a Put Notice after the date that is six (6) months
following the expiration of the applicable Decision Period in the case of Section
2.2(a)(ii)(2).


          (d) The Company shall, and HSI and Burns shall cause the Company to, provide the Designated
Investment Banker with access, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to
management of the Company and to such documents and information as it shall reasonably request,
including, without limitation, the most recently approved Company Budget and projections for the
Companys next fiscal year presented by Company management to the Company Board. Any access under
this Section 2.5(d) shall be subject to such limitations


as the Company may reasonably require to prevent the disclosure of non-public information
and/or the material disruption of the business of the Company, including, without limitation, the
execution of a non-disclosure agreement by the Designated Investment Banker in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company. The Company shall provide reasonable prior written notice
to HSI and Burns of any access to be provided by the Company to the Designated Investment Banker.
HSI, Burns and their respective representatives shall have the right to accompany the Designated
Investment Banker on any visits to Companys facilities or in any meetings between the Designated
Investment Banker and management of the Company.


          (e) All fees, costs and expenses of the Designated Investment Banker incurred in connection
with the determination of the Burns Put Price hereunder shall be borne by the Company.


          (f) The Burns Put Rights granted hereunder are personal to Burns and may not be transferred or
assigned by Burns other than in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof.

agreements executed pursuant hereto, no course of dealing between or among any of the parties
hereto and no delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any rights hereunder or
thereunder shall operate as a waiver of the rights hereof and thereof.


     3.4. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such
provision and shall not in any manner affect or render illegal, invalid or unenforceable any other


provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be carried out as if any such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.


     3.5. Integration. This Agreement, including the exhibits, documents and instruments
referred to herein or therein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.


     3.6. Construction. The Article and Section headings used or contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction of this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
with counsel sophisticated in investment transactions. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.


     3.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.


     3.8. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; provided, that no party may directly or indirectly assign, delegate or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of HSI and
Burns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) HSI shall be entitled to assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, without the consent of any other party hereto, to any Affiliate
of HSI; and (b) Burns shall be entitled to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement,
without the consent of any other party hereto to its Permitted Primary Transferees;
provided, however, that (i) one Person reasonably acceptable to HSI, shall be
appointed as agent with full power and authority to act conclusively and timely for and on behalf
of all such Permitted Primary Transferees with respect to their rights and obligations hereunder,
on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to HSI and (ii) HSI shall not incur or become
subject to any additional obligations as a result of any such assignment. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that HSI (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each case, the successors
and purchasers of HSI or HSIs properties and assets, as appropriate, shall agree to fulfill and
comply with the obligations set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any assignment by any
party of its obligations hereunder, such assigning party shall remain primarily liable for all
obligations so assigned.
