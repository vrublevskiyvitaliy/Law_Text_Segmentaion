GRANT OF OPTIONS







3.1
 
The Board may grant an option to any Eligible Employee who has submitted a valid application
to acquire Shares in the Company upon the terms set out in this Plan and for this purpose,
unless the Board determines otherwise, an option to acquire includes an option to purchase and
an option to subscribe.


 

3.2
 
The number of Shares in respect of which an option may be granted to any individual shall be
the maximum number which can be paid for, at the price determined under Rule 3.5 below, with
monies equal to the amount of the Savings Contract Repayment due on the Maturity Date under
the Savings Contract to be made in connection with the option and if necessary converted into
US dollars at the Dollar Exchange Rate on the dealing day by reference to which the share
price is determined.


 

3.3
 
For the purposes of 3.2 above, the Savings Contract Repayment on the Maturity Date shall be
taken as including interest at the Assumed Rate of Interest unless the Board shall have
determined, in relation to every option to be granted on the day in question, that it shall be
taken as not including such interest.


 

3.4
 
The amount of the monthly contribution under the Savings Contract to be made in connection
with an option granted to an individual shall, subject to Rule 4 below, be the amount which
the individual shall have specified in his application for the option that he






 
 
is willing to
pay or, if lower, the maximum permitted amount, that is to say, the maximum amount which:







 
3.4.1
 
when aggregated with the amount of his monthly contributions under any other
Savings Contract linked to this Plan or to any other savings-related share option plan
adopted by the Company, does not exceed the local currency equivalent of £250 but
exceeds a minimum of the equivalent £5 (and for this purpose the local currency
equivalent shall be calculated using the Sterling Exchange Rate on the dealing day by
reference to which the exercise price is determined) or such other maximum or minimum
amounts as may for the time being be permitted by the Board;


 

 
3.4.2
 
does not exceed the maximum amount for the time being permitted under the
terms of the Savings Contract; and


 

 
3.4.3
 
when aggregated with the amount of his monthly contributions under any other
Savings Contract linked to this Plan, does not exceed any maximum amount determined by
the Board.







3.5
 
The price at which Shares may be acquired by the exercise of options granted on any day shall
be determined by the Board, provided that:







 
3.5.1
 
if shares of the same class as those Shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, the price shall not be less than the Specified Percentage of the closing
price of the Shares quoted in the Wall Street Journal on such dealing day as the Board
may choose provided that such day shall fall prior to the date on which applications
for options must be received by the Company;


 

 
3.5.2
 
and where 3.5.1 does not apply the price shall not be less than the Specified
Percentage of the market value of the Shares determined in accordance with Part VIII of
the UK Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992;


 

 
3.5.3
 
the price may be set in US dollars or in any local currency equivalent
specified by the Board (and for this purpose the local currency equivalent shall be
calculated using the Dollar Exchange Rate on the dealing day by reference to which the
share price is determined);







3.6
 
An option granted to any person:







 
3.6.1
 
shall not, except as provided in Rule 5.3, be capable of being transferred by him; and



 


 
3.6.2
 
shall lapse forthwith if he is adjudged bankrupt.







4.
 
LIMITS


 

4.1
 
No options shall be granted to acquire a number of Shares which exceeds any number determined
by the Board for this purpose.


 

4.2
 
If the grant of options on any day would but for this Rule 4.2 cause the limit in Rule 4.1
above to be exceeded, the Board shall scale down applications by reducing the monthly
contributions stated in applications for options in a manner which the Board considers






 
 
fair and reasonable or adopt such other provision for scaling down the number of Shares available
so far as is necessary to ensure that such limit is not exceeded.


 

4.3
 
If the applications, as scaled down, are still for more Shares than are available, the Board
may decide no options will be granted on that occasion.







5.
 
EXERCISE OF OPTIONS


 

5.1
 
The exercise of any option granted under this Plan shall be effected in the form and manner
prescribed by the Board, but to the extent that the actual savings made together with any
interest earned in respect of such savings are not sufficient to acquire the total number of
Shares in respect of which the option is exercisable (due to exchange rate movements, the
amount of interest received being less than interest receivable at the Assumed Rate of
Interest or missed savings contributions up to but not exceeding six monthly contributions),
the Participant may, if he so wishes, use funds separately provided by him to make up this
shortfall in order that the number of Shares in respect of which the option is exercisable may
be acquired.


 

5.2
 
Subject to Rules 5.3, 5.4, 5.6 and 6, an option granted under this Plan shall not be capable
of being exercised before the Maturity Date.


 

5.3
 
Subject to Rule 5.8:







 
5.3.1
 
if any Participant dies before the Maturity Date, any option granted to him
may (and must, if at all) be exercised by his personal representatives within 12 months
after the date of his death provided that the total number of Shares which may be
acquired on exercise of the option shall not exceed the number of Shares which can be
acquired with the actual savings made together with any interest earned on the date of
death; and


 

 
5.3.2
 
if he dies on or within 6 months after the Maturity Date, any option granted
to him may (and must, if at all) be exercised by his personal representatives within 12
months after the Maturity Date provided that the total number of Shares which may be
acquired on exercise of the option shall not exceed the number of Shares which can be
acquired with the actual savings made together with any interest earned on the date of
death;


 

 
 
 
provided in either case that his death occurs at a time when he either holds the
office or employment by virtue of which he is eligible to participate in this Plan
or is entitled to exercise the option by virtue of Rule 5.4.







5.4
 
Subject to Rule 5.8, if any Participant ceases to hold the office or employment by virtue of
which he is eligible to participate in this Plan (otherwise than by reason of his death), the
following provisions apply in relation to any option granted to him:







 
5.4.1
 
if he so ceases by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, or retirement on
reaching the age of 65 or any other age at which he is bound to retire in accordance
with the terms of his contract of employment, the option may (and subject to Rule 6.3
must, if at all) be exercised within 6 months of his so ceasing provided that the total
number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the option shall not exceed the
number of Shares which can be






 
 
 
acquired with the actual savings made together with any
interest earned on the date of his ceasing employment;


 

 
5.4.2
 
if he so ceases by reason only that the office or employment is in a company
of which the Company ceases to have control, or relates to a business or part of a
business which is transferred to a person who is neither an Associated Company of the
Company nor a company of which the Company has control, the option may (and subject to
Rule 5.3 must, if at all) be exercised within 6 months of his so ceasing provided that
the total number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the option shall not
exceed the number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual savings made together with
any interest earned on the date of his ceasing employment;


 

 
5.4.3
 
if he so ceases by reason of retirement at any age at which he is entitled to
retire in accordance with the terms of his contract of employment (other than at 65 or
any age at which he is bound to retire), early retirement with the agreement of the
employer, or pregnancy, but in each case only if such cessation of office or employment
is more than three years after the Grant Date, the option may (and subject to Rule 6.3
must if at all) be exercised within 6 months of his so ceasing provided that the total
number of shares which may be acquired on exercise of the option shall not exceed the
number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual savings made together with any
interest earned on the date of his ceasing employment;


 

 
5.4.4
 
if he so ceases for any other reason the option may not be exercised at all.







 
 
For the purposes of the Plan, a woman who leaves employment due to pregnancy will
be regarded as having left the employment on the day on which she indicates that she
does not intend to return to work. In the absence of such indication she will be
regarded as having left employment on the last day on which she is entitled to return
to work, or if later, any other date specified in the terms of her employment.







5.5
 
Subject to Rule 5.8, if, at the Maturity Date, a Participant holds an office or employment
with a company which is not a Participating Company but which is an Associated Company or a
company of which the Company has control, any option granted to him may (and subject to Rule
5.3 must, if at all) be exercised within 6 months of the Maturity Date.


 

5.6
 
Subject to Rule 5.8, where any Participant continues to hold the office or employment by
virtue of which he is eligible to participate in this Plan after the date on which he reaches
the age of 65, he may exercise any option within 6 months of that date to the extent of the
Savings Contract Repayment on the date on which he reaches 65.


 

5.7
 
Subject to Rule 5.3, an option shall not be capable of being exercised later than 6 months
after the Maturity Date.


 

5.8
 
Where, before an option has become capable of being exercised, the Participant gives notice
that he intends to stop paying monthly contributions under the Savings Contract made in
connection with the option, or is deemed under its terms to have given such






 
 
notice, or makes
an application for repayment of the monthly contributions paid under it, the option may not be
exercised at all.


 

5.9
 
A Participant shall not be treated for the purposes of Rules 5.3 and 5.4 as ceasing to hold
the office or employment by virtue of which he is eligible to participate in this Plan until
he ceases to hold an office or employment in the Company or any Associated Company or company
of which the Company has control.


 

5.10
 
A Participant shall not be eligible to exercise an option at any time unless, subject to
Rules 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, he is at that time a director or employee of a Participating Company.


 

5.11
 
An option shall not be capable of being exercised more than once.


 

5.12
 
An option may not be exercised unless:







 
5.12.1
 
the Board consider that the issue or transfer of Shares pursuant to such
exercise would be lawful in all relevant jurisdictions; and


 

 
5.12.2
 
in a case where, if the option were exercised, a Group Member would be
obliged to (or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any tax (in
any jurisdiction) for which the person in question would be liable by virtue of the
exercise of the option and/or for any social security contributions that would be
recoverable from the person in question (together, the Tax Liability), that person
has either:







 
(a)
 
made a payment to the Group Member of an amount at least
equal to the Companys estimate of the Tax Liability;


 

 
(b)
 
entered into arrangements acceptable to that or another Group
Member to secure that such a payment is made (whether by authorising the sale
of some or all of the Shares on his behalf and the payment to the Group Member
of the relevant amount out of the proceeds of sale or otherwise); or


 

 
(c)
 
the Group Member and the person in question have agreed that
the Tax Liability otherwise recoverable from him shall be waived.







5.13
 
Within 30 days after an option has been exercised by any person, the Board shall allot to him
(or a nominee for him) or, as appropriate, procure the transfer to him (or a nominee for him)
of the number of Shares in respect of which the option has been exercised, provided that the
Board considers that the issue or transfer of those Shares.


 

5.14
 
All Shares allotted under this Plan shall rank equally in all respects with Shares of the
same class then in issue except for any rights attaching to such Shares by reference to a
record date before the date of the allotment.







6.
 
TAKEOVER, RECONSTRUCTION AND WINDING UP


 

6.1
 
If any person obtains control of the Company as a result of making a general offer to acquire
Shares in the Company, or having obtained control makes such an offer, subject to Rules 5.3,
5.4, 5.7, 5.8 and 6.5, any option may be exercised within 6 months after that






 
 
person has
obtained control provided that the total number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise of
the option shall not exceed the number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual savings
made together with any interest earned on the day of exercise.







6.2
 
For the purposes of Rule 6.1, a change of control shall mean: (a) the acquisition of
ownership, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, by any Person or group (within
the meaning of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act), and
the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission there under as in effect on the date
hereof) of the ordinary shares of the Company representing more than 50% of the aggregate
voting power represented by the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company; or (b)
occupation of a majority of the seats (other than vacant seats) on the Board by Persons who
were neither (i) nominated by the Companys Board nor (ii) appointed by directors so
nominated. For the avoidance of doubt, a transaction shall not constitute a change of control
(i) if effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation or form of organisation
of the ultimate parent entity of the Willis group of companies (including where the Company is
succeeded by an issuer incorporated under the laws of another state, country or foreign
government for such purpose and whether or not the Company remains in existence following such
transaction) and (ii) where all or substantially all of the Person(s) who are the beneficial
owners of the outstanding voting securities of the Company immediately prior to such
transaction will beneficially own, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the
combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the ultimate parent entity resulting from such transaction in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership, immediately prior to such transaction,
of such outstanding securities of the Company. The Board, in its sole discretion, may make an
appropriate and equitable adjustment to the ordinary shares underlying an option to take into
account such transaction, including to substitute or provide for the issuance of ordinary
shares of the resulting ultimate parent entity in lieu of ordinary shares of the Company.
Person, as used herein, shall have the meaning found in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the
Exchange Act.


 

6.3
 
If under section 201 of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (or any other equivalent legislation)
the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement proposed for the purposes of, or in connection
with, a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its amalgamation with any other
company or companies, subject to Rules 5.3, 5.4, 5.7 and 5.8, any option may be exercised
within six months of the court sanctioning the compromise or arrangement, provided that the
total number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the option shall not exceed the
number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual savings made together with any interest
earned on the day of exercise, but to the extent that it is not exercised within that period
shall (notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan) lapse on expiration of that period.


 

6.4
 
If a resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the Company is passed, subject to Rules 5.3,
5.4, 5.7 and 5.8, any option may be exercised within two months from the date of the passing
of the resolution, provided that the total number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise
of the option shall not exceed the number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual
savings made together with any interest earned on the day of






 
 
exercise, but to the extent that
it is not exercised within that period shall (notwithstanding any other provision of this
Plan) lapse on expiration of that period.


 

6.5
 
If any person becomes bound or entitled to acquire Shares under section 204 of the Irish
Companies Act 1963 (or any other equivalent legislation) subject to Rules 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6,
5.7, and 5.8, any option may be exercised at any time when that person remains so bound or
entitled provided that the total number of Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the
option shall not exceed the number of Shares which can be acquired with the actual savings
made together with any interest earned on the day of exercise, but to the extent that it is
not exercised within that period shall (notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan)
lapse on the expiration of that period.


 

6.6
 
If any company (the Acquiring Company):







 
6.6.1
 
obtains control of the Company as a result of making-







 
(a)
 
a general offer to acquire the whole of the issued common
share capital of the Company which is made on a condition such that if it is
satisfied the acquiring company will have control of the Company, or


 

 
(b)
 
a general offer to acquire all the Shares in the Company
which are of the same class as the Shares which may be acquired by the
exercise of options granted under this Plan, or







 
6.6.2
 
obtains control of the Company in pursuance of a compromise or arrangement
sanctioned by the court under section 201 of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (or under any
other equivalent legislation), or


 

 
6.6.3
 
becomes bound or entitled to acquire Shares in the Company under section 204
of the Irish Companies Act 1963 (or under any other equivalent legislation),







 
 
any Participant may at any time within the appropriate period (which expression shall be
construed in accordance with paragraph 38(3) of Schedule 3 for the purposes of the UK SAYE
Plan), by agreement with the Acquiring Company, release any option which has not lapsed
(the old option) in consideration of the grant to him of an option (the new option)
which (for the purposes of that paragraph) is equivalent to the old option but relates to
Shares in a different company.







6.7
 
The provisions of this Plan shall for this purpose be construed as if:







 
6.7.1
 
the new option were an option granted under this Plan at the same time as the
old option;


 

 
6.7.2
 
except for the purposes of the definitions of Participating Company and
Subsidiary in Rules 1.1, 5.4.2, 5.5 and 5.9, the expression the Company were
defined as a company whose Shares may be acquired by the exercise of options granted
under this Plan;


 

 
6.7.3
 
the Savings Contract made in connection with the old option had been made in
connection with the new option; and






 
6.7.4
 
the Maturity Date in relation to the new option were the same as that in
relation to the old option.







7.
 
ADJUSTMENT OF OPTIONS


 

7.1
 
In the event of any variation of the share capital of the Company, the Board may make such
adjustments as it considers appropriate under Rule 7.2.


 

7.2
 
An adjustment made under this Rule shall be to one or more of the following:







 
7.2.1
 
the number of Shares in respect of which any option may be exercised;


 

 
7.2.2
 
the price at which Shares may be acquired by the exercise of any option;


 

 
7.2.3
 
where any option has been exercised but no Shares have been allotted or
transferred pursuant to the exercise, the number of Shares which may be allotted or
transferred and the price at which they may be acquired.







8.
 
ALTERATIONS


 

8.1
 
Subject to Rule 8.2 below the Board may at any time alter or add to all or any of the
provisions of the Plan.


 

8.2
 
No alteration or addition shall be made under Rule 8.1 which would abrogate or adversely
affect the subsisting rights of a Participant, unless it is made:







 
(i)
 
with the consent in writing of such number of Participants as hold options to
acquire not less than 75 per cent of the Shares which would be issued or transferred if
all options granted and subsisting were exercised in respect of the maximum of Shares
the subject thereof; or


 

 
(ii)
 
by a resolution at a meeting of Participants passed by not less than 75 per
cent of the Participants who attend and vote either in person or by proxy,







 
 
and for the purposes of this Rule 8.2 the Participants shall be treated as the holders of a
separate class of share capital and the provisions of the Constitution of the Company
relating to class meetings shall apply mutatis mutandis.







8.3
 
Rule 8.2 shall not apply to any alteration or addition which:







 
(i)
 
is necessary or desirable in order to comply with or take account of the
provisions of any proposed or existing legislation or law, to take advantage of any
changes to the legislation or law, to take account of any of the events mentioned in
Rule 7, or to obtain or maintain favourable taxation treatment of the Company, any
Subsidiary or any Participant; and


 

 
(ii)
 
does not affect the basic principles of the Plan, the calculation of the price
payable per share under an option or the limit in Rule 4.







9.
 
CASH EQUIVALENT


 

9.1
 
Where an option granted under the Plan has been exercised by any person in respect of any
number of Shares, and those Shares have not yet been allotted or transferred to him in
accordance with Rule 5.13 above, the Board may determine that, in substitution for his






 
 
right to acquire such number of those Shares as the Board may decide (but in full and final satisfaction of his
said right), he shall be paid a sum equal to the cash equivalent of that number of Shares.


 

9.2
 
For the purposes of this Rule, the cash equivalent of any Shares is the amount by which the
Boards opinion of the market value of those Shares on the business day prior to the date on
which the option was exercised (or, if at the relevant time Shares of the same class as those
Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the closing price of Shares of that class

the closing price) by reference to which the cash equivalent is calculated, or in
purchasing such Shares, or partly in one way and partly in the other, and
