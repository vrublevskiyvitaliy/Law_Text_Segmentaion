discount thereon

 

SECTION
9.     Special Covenants With
Respect to the Securities Collateral.

 

(a)            Form of Securities
Collateral.  Secured Party shall have the right at any time to
exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Securities
Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger
denominations.  If any Securities Collateral is not a security
pursuant to Section 8-103 of the UCC, no Grantor shall take any action that,
under such Section, converts such Securities Collateral into a security without
causing the issuer thereof to issue to it certificates or instruments evidencing
such Securities Collateral, which it shall promptly deliver to Secured
Party.

 

(b)            Covenants.  Each
Grantor shall (i) not, except as expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement,
permit any issuer of Pledged Subsidiary Equity to merge or consolidate unless
all the outstanding Equity Interests of the surviving or resulting Person are,
upon such merger or consolidation, pledged and become Collateral hereunder and
no cash, securities or other property is distributed in respect of the
outstanding Equity Interests of any other constituent corporation; (ii) cause
each issuer of Pledged Subsidiary Equity not to issue Equity Interests in
addition to or in substitution for the Pledged Subsidiary Equity issued by such
issuer, except to such Grantor; (iii) upon its acquisition (directly or
indirectly) of any Pledged Subsidiary Equity, comply with Section 5(b); (iv)
upon its issuance of any and all Instruments or other evidences of additional
Indebtedness with a face amount in excess of $500,000, comply with Section 5(b); (v)
promptly deliver to Secured Party all written notices received by it with
respect to the Securities Collateral; (vi) at its expense (A) perform and comply
in all material respects with all terms and provisions of any agreement related
to the Securities Collateral required to be performed or complied with by it,
(B) maintain all such agreements in full force and effect and (C) enforce all
such agreements in accordance with their terms; and (vii), at the request of
Secured Party, promptly execute and deliver to Secured Party an agreement
providing for control by Secured Party of all Security Entitlements, Securities
Accounts, Commodity Contracts and Commodity Accounts of such
Grantor.

(c)            Voting and
Distributions.  So long as the Lender shall have given notice
of its intent to exercise such rights at any time an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, (i) each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise any
and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Securities
Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement or the Credit Agreement; provided, no Grantor
shall exercise or refrain from exercising any such right if Secured Party shall
have notified such Grantor that, in Secured Party’s reasonable judgment, such
action would have a material adverse effect on the value of the Securities
Collateral or any part thereof; and (ii) each Grantor shall be entitled to
receive and retain any and all dividends, other distributions, principal and
interest paid in respect of the Securities Collateral.

 

Upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, (x) upon written
notice from Secured Party to any Grantor, all rights of such Grantor to exercise
the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to
exercise pursuant hereto shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become
vested in Secured Party who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such
voting and other consensual rights; (y) except as otherwise specified in the
Credit Agreement, all rights of such Grantor to receive the dividends, other
distributions, principal and interest payments which it would otherwise be
authorized to receive and retain pursuant hereto shall cease, and all such
rights shall thereupon become vested in Secured Party who shall thereupon have
the sole right to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends, other
distributions, principal and interest payments; and (z) all dividends,
principal, interest payments and other distributions which are received by such
Grantor contrary to the provisions of clause (y) above shall be received in
trust for the benefit of Secured Party, shall be segregated from other funds of
such Grantor and shall forthwith be paid over to Secured Party as Collateral in
the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsements).

 

In order
to permit Secured Party to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which
it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and
other distributions which it may be entitled to receive hereunder, (I) each
Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and
delivered) to Secured Party all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other
instruments as Secured Party may from time to time reasonably request, and (II)
without limiting the effect of clause (I) above, each Grantor hereby grants to
Secured Party an irrevocable proxy to vote the Pledged Equity and to exercise
all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies to which a holder of the
Pledged Equity would be entitled (including giving or withholding written
consents of holders of Equity Interests, calling special meetings of holders of
Equity Interests and voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective,
automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer of
any Pledged Equity on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other
Person (including the issuer of the Pledged Equity or any officer or agent
thereof), upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and which proxy shall only
terminate upon the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, the cure of such
Event of Default or waiver thereof as evidenced by a writing executed by Secured
Party.

 

SECTION
      10.

Special Covenants With
      Respect to the Intellectual Property
  Collateral.

 

(a)           Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 10, each
Grantor shall continue to collect, at its own expense, all amounts due or to
become due to such Grantor in respect of the Intellectual Property Collateral or
any portion thereof.  In connection with such collections, each
Grantor may take (and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default at Secured Party’s reasonable direction, shall take) such
action as such Grantor or Secured Party may deem reasonably necessary or
advisable to enforce collection of such amounts; provided, Secured
Party shall have the right at any time, upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, to notify the obligors with respect to any
such amounts of the existence of the security interest created hereby and to
direct such obligors to make payment of all such amounts directly to Secured
Party, and, upon such notification and at the expense of such Grantor, to
enforce collection of any such amounts and to adjust, settle or compromise the
amount or payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as such
Grantor might have done.  Upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default and upon receipt by any Grantor of notice
from Secured Party, (i) all amounts and proceeds (including checks and
Instruments) received by each Grantor in respect of amounts due to such Grantor
in respect of the Intellectual Property Collateral or any portion thereof shall
be received in trust for the benefit of Secured Party hereunder, shall be
segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over or
delivered to Secured Party in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement) to be held as cash Collateral and applied as provided by Section 16 hereof,
and (ii) such Grantor shall not adjust, settle or compromise the amount or
payment of any such amount or release wholly or partly any obligor with respect
thereto or allow any credit or discount thereon.

 




10








 

(b)           Except
as provided herein, each Grantor shall have the right to commence and prosecute
in its own name, as real party in interest, for its own benefit and at its own
expense, such suits, proceedings or other actions for infringement, unfair
competition, dilution, misappropriation or other damage, or reexamination or
reissue proceedings as are necessary to protect the Intellectual Property
Collateral.

 

(c)           In
addition to, and not by way of limitation of, the granting of a security
interest in the Collateral pursuant hereto, each Grantor, effective upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, hereby assigns,
transfers and conveys to Secured Party the nonexclusive right and license to use
all Trademarks, tradenames, Copyrights, Patents or technical processes
(including, without limitation, the Intellectual Property Collateral) owned or
used by such Grantor that relate to the Collateral, together with any goodwill
associated therewith, all to the extent necessary to enable Secured Party to
realize on the Collateral in accordance with this Agreement and to enable any
transferee or assignee of the Collateral to enjoy the benefits of the
Collateral.  This right shall inure to the benefit of all successors,
assigns and transferees of Secured Party and its successors, assigns and
transferees, whether by voluntary conveyance, operation of law, assignment,
transfer, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise.  Such
right and license shall be granted free of charge, without requirement that any
monetary payment whatsoever be made to such Grantor.

 

 

SECTION
      11.

Secured Party
      Appointed Attorney-in-Fact.

 

Each
Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints Secured Party as such Grantor’s
attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and
in the name of such Grantor, Secured Party or otherwise, from time to time in
Secured Party’s discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that
Secured Party may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement, including, without limitation:

(c)               upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to receive,
endorse and collect any drafts or other Instruments, Documents, Chattel Paper
and other documents in connection with clauses (a) and (b) above;

 

(d)               upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to file any
claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that Secured Party may

otherwise to enforce or protect the rights of Secured Party with respect to any
of the Collateral;

 

(e)               to
pay or discharge taxes or Liens (other than taxes not required to be discharged
pursuant to the Credit Agreement and Liens permitted under this Agreement or the
Credit Agreement) levied or placed upon or threatened against the Collateral,
the legality or validity thereof and the amounts necessary to discharge the same
to be determined by Secured Party in its sole discretion, any such payments made
by Secured Party to become obligations of such Grantor to Secured Party, due and
payable immediately without demand;

 

(f)               upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to sign and
endorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading, storage or

Collateral;

 

(g)               upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, generally to
sell, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal
with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as though Secured Party were
the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and to do, at Secured Party’s
option and Grantors’ expense, at any time or from time to time, all acts and
things that Secured Party deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon
the Collateral and Secured Party’s security interest therein in order to effect
the intent of this Agreement, all as fully and effectively as such Grantor might
do; and

 

(h)               upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) endorse
and collect any cash proceeds of the Collateral and apply the proceeds of any
Collateral to the Secured Obligations, (ii) demand payment or enforce payment of

Secured Party or any Grantor and to endorse any and all checks, drafts and other
instruments for the payment of money relating to the Credit Card Receivables,
(iii) sign any Grantor’s name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to the

rights and remedies with respect to the collection of the Credit Card
Receivables, (v) settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceeding brought to

name on a proof of claim in bankruptcy or similar document against any Account

connection with the Credit Card Receivables and (viii) change the address for

may designate to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to such
Grantor.

 

All acts
of said attorney-in-fact are hereby ratified and approved by the
Grantors.  The powers conferred on the Secured Party under this Section 11 are solely
to protect the Secured Party’s interests in the Collateral and shall not impose
any duty upon the Secured Party to exercise any such powers.

 




12








 

SECTION
      12.

Secured Party May
      Perform.

 

If any
Grantor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, Secured Party may
itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of
Secured Party incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Grantors
under Section
17(b).

 

SECTION
      13.

Standard of
      Care.

 

The
powers conferred on Secured Party hereunder are solely to protect its interest
in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such
powers.  Except for the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of
any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received
by it hereunder, Secured Party shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to
the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or
any other rights pertaining to any Collateral.  Secured Party shall be
deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of
Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment
substantially equal to that which Secured Party accords its own
property.

 

SECTION
      14.

Remedies.

 

(a)        Generally.  If any
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Secured Party may,
subject to Section
19 hereof,  exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition
to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to
it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC
(whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and also may (i)
require each Grantor to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its
expense and upon request of Secured Party forthwith, assemble all or part of the
Collateral and all documentation related thereto as directed by Secured Party
and make it available to Secured Party at a place to be designated by Secured
Party that is reasonably convenient to both parties, (ii) enter onto the
property where any Collateral or any documentation related thereto is located
and take possession thereof with or without judicial process, (iii) prior to the
disposition of the Collateral, store, process, repair or recondition the
Collateral or otherwise prepare the Collateral for disposition in any manner to
the extent Secured Party deems appropriate, (iv) take possession of any
Grantor’s premises or place custodians in exclusive control thereof, remain on
such premises and use the same and any of such Grantor’s equipment for the
purpose of completing any work in process, taking any actions described in the
preceding clause (iii) and collecting any Secured Obligation, (v) without notice
except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or
more parcels at public or private sale, at any of Secured Party’s offices or
elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and
at such price or prices and upon such other terms as Secured Party may deem
commercially reasonable, (vi) exercise dominion and control over, provide
instructions directing the disposition of funds, instruments, securities and
other property in and refuse to permit further withdrawals from any Deposit
Account maintained with Secured Party or any Lender and provide instructions
directing the disposition of funds in Deposit Accounts not maintained with
Secured Party or any Lender and (vii) provide entitlement orders with respect to
Security Entitlements and other Investment Property constituting a part of the
Collateral and, without notice to any Grantor, transfer to or register in the
name of Secured Party or any of its nominees any or all of the Securities
Collateral.  Secured Party or any Lender may be the purchaser of any
or all of the Collateral at any such sale and Secured Party, as agent for and
representative of Lenders (but not any Lender  in its individual
capacity unless all the Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing), shall be
entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the
purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public
sale, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as a credit on account of
the purchase price for any Collateral payable by Secured Party at such
sale.  Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold
absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each
Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights of
redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the
future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter
enacted.  Each Grantor agrees 

 




13








 

that, to
the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least ten days’ notice to
such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which
any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
notification.  Secured Party shall not be obligated to make any sale
of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given.  Secured
Party may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement
at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice,
be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned.  Each
Grantor hereby waives any claims against Secured Party arising by reason of the
fact that the price at which any Collateral may have been sold at such a private
sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale,
even if Secured Party accepts the first offer received and does not offer such
Collateral to more than one offeree.  If the proceeds of any sale or
other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Secured
Obligations, Grantors shall be jointly and severally liable for the deficiency
and the fees of any attorneys employed by Secured Party to collect such
deficiency.  Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the
covenants contained in this Section 14 will cause
irreparable injury to Secured Party, that Secured Party has no adequate remedy
at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every
covenant contained in this Section shall be specifically enforceable against
such Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any
defenses against an action for specific performance of such covenants except for
a defense that no default has occurred giving rise to the Secured Obligations
becoming due and payable prior to their stated maturities.

 

(b)        Securities
Collateral.  Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, Secured Party may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any
part of the Securities Collateral conducted without prior registration or
qualification of such Securities Collateral under the Securities Act and/or such
state securities laws, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other
things, to acquire the Securities Collateral for their own account, for
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof.  Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private placement
may be at prices and on terms less favorable than those obtainable through a
sale without such restrictions (including an offering made pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, each Grantor agrees that any such private placement shall not be
deemed, in and of itself, to be commercially unreasonable and that Secured Party
shall have no obligation to delay the sale of any Securities Collateral for the
period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form
of sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under applicable
state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or should, agree to so
register it.  If Secured Party determines to exercise its right to
sell any or all of the Securities Collateral, upon written request, each Grantor
shall and shall cause each issuer of any Securities Collateral to be sold
hereunder from time to time to furnish to Secured Party all such information as
Secured Party may request in order to determine the amount of Securities
Collateral which may be sold by Secured Party in exempt transactions under the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.

 

SECTION
      15.

Additional Remedies
      for Intellectual Property
Collateral.

 

(a)        Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of an Event of Default, (i) Secured Party shall have the right
(but not the obligation) to bring suit, in the name of any Grantor, Secured
Party or otherwise, to enforce any Intellectual Property Collateral, in which
event each Grantor shall, at the request of Secured Party, do any and all lawful
acts and execute any and all documents required by Secured Party in aid of such
enforcement and each Grantor shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse and
indemnify Secured Party as provided in Section 7 of the Credit Agreement and
Section 17
hereof, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of its rights under this
Section 15,
and, to the extent that Secured Party shall elect not to bring suit to enforce
any Intellectual Property Collateral as provided in this Section, each Grantor
agrees to use all reasonable measures, whether by action, suit, proceeding or
otherwise, to prevent the infringement of any of the Intellectual Property
Collateral by others and for that purpose agrees to use its commercially
reasonable judgment in 

 




14








 

maintaining
any action, suit or proceeding against any Person so infringing reasonably
necessary to prevent such infringement; (ii) upon written demand from Secured
Party, each Grantor shall execute and deliver to Secured Party an assignment or
assignments of the Intellectual Property Collateral and such other documents as
are necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Agreement; (iii) each Grantor agrees that such an assignment and/or recording
shall be applied to reduce the Secured Obligations outstanding only to the
extent that Secured Party (or any Lender) receives cash proceeds in respect of
the sale of, or other realization upon, the Intellectual Property Collateral;
and (iv) within five Business Days after written notice from Secured Party, each
Grantor shall make available to Secured Party, to the extent within such
Grantor’s power and authority, such personnel in such Grantor’s employ as
Secured Party may reasonably designate, by name, title or job responsibility, to
permit such Grantor to continue, directly or indirectly, to produce, advertise
and sell the products and services sold or delivered by such Grantor under or in
connection with the Trademarks, Trademark Registrations and Trademark Rights,
such persons to be available to perform their prior functions on Secured Party’s
behalf and to be compensated by Secured Party at such Grantor’s expense on a per
diem, pro-rata basis consistent with the salary and benefit structure applicable
to each as of the date of such Event of Default.

 

(b)        If
(i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and, by reason of cure, waiver,
modification, amendment or otherwise, no longer be continuing, (ii) no other
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (iii) an assignment to
Secured Party of any rights, title and interests in and to the Intellectual
Property Collateral shall have been previously made, and (iv) the Secured
Obligations shall not have become immediately due and payable, upon the written
request of any Grantor, Secured Party shall promptly execute and deliver to such
Grantor such assignments as may be necessary to reassign to such Grantor any
such rights, title and interests as may have been assigned to Secured Party as
aforesaid, subject to any disposition thereof that may have been made by Secured
Party; provided, after giving effect to such reassignment, Secured Party’s
security interest granted pursuant hereto, as well as all other rights and
remedies of Secured Party granted hereunder, shall continue to be in full force
and effect; and provided further, the rights, title and interests so reassigned
shall be free and clear of all Liens other than Liens (if any) encumbering such
rights, title and interest at the time of their assignment to Secured Party and
Permitted Encumbrances.

 

SECTION
      16.

Application of
      Proceeds.

 

Except as
expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all proceeds received by Secured
Party in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all
or any part of the Collateral shall be applied in the following order of
priority:

 

FIRST:  To
the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other
realization, including reasonable compensation to Secured Party and its agents,
advisors and counsel, and all other expenses, liabilities and advances made or
incurred by Secured Party in connection therewith, and all amounts for which
Secured Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder and all advances made by
Secured Party hereunder for the account of Grantors, and to the payment of all
costs and expenses paid or incurred by Secured Party in connection with the
exercise of any right or remedy hereunder;

 

SECOND:  To
the payment of all other Secured Obligations (for the ratable benefit of the
holders thereof); and

 

THIRD:  To
the payment to or upon the order of the Borrower, or to whosoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction
may direct, of any surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

      17.

Indemnity and
      Expenses.

 

(a)        Grantors
jointly and severally agree to indemnify Secured Party and each
Lender  from and against any and all claims, losses and liabilities in
any way relating to, growing out of or resulting from this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, enforcement of
this Agreement), except to the extent such claims, losses or liabilities result
solely from Secured Party’s or such Lender’s gross negligence or willful
misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 

(b)        Grantors
jointly and severally agree to pay to Secured Party upon demand the amount of
any and all costs and expenses in accordance with subsection 7.1 of the Credit

obligations of Grantors in this Section 17 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the discharge of Grantors’ other

Documents.

 

SECTION
      18.

Continuing Security
      Interest; Transfer of Loans; Termination and
    Release.

 

(a)        This
Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and
shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full
in immediately available funds of the principal, interest and all other amounts
under this Credit Agreement and under any other Loan Document and the
termination of this Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document and the
cancellation or termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments, (ii) be binding
upon Grantors and their respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure,
together with the rights and remedies of Secured Party hereunder, to the benefit
of Secured Party and its successors, transferees and assigns.

 

       
(b)        Upon the indefeasible payment
in full of all Secured Obligations in immediately available funds and the
cancellation or termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments, the security
interest granted hereby in the Collateral shall automatically terminate and all
rights to the Collateral shall revert to the applicable
Grantors.  Upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of any
item of Collateral (including, without limitation, as a result of (x) the sale
or other transfer or disposition of the Subsidiary that owns such Collateral
other than to a Person that is, or is required to be, a Grantor or Additional
Grantor or (y) the merger, consolidation, amalgamation or dissolution of the
Subsidiary that owns such Collateral other than a merger, consolidation or
amalgamation with or a Person that is, or is required to be, a Grantor or
Additional Grantor), in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents, the security interest granted hereby in such item of Collateral shall
automatically terminate and all rights to such item of Collateral shall revert
to the applicable Grantors.  Upon any such release described in this
Section 18(b),
the Secured Party, at the Borrower’s expense, shall execute and deliver to such
Grantor such documents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Secured
Party (and without recourse to or warranty by the Secured Party) as may be
reasonably requested to evidence such release of such Collateral from the
assignment and security interest granted hereunder.

hereunder, to make demands, to give notices, to exercise or refrain from
exercising any rights, and to take or refrain from taking any action (including,
without limitation, the release or substitution of Collateral), solely in
accordance with this Agreement and the Credit Agreement; provided that Secured
Party shall exercise, or refrain from exercising, any remedies provided for in
Sections 14 and
15 hereof in
accordance with the instructions of the Lenders.

      20.

Additional
      Grantors.

 

    
The initial Grantors hereunder shall be the Borrower and such of the
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as are signatories hereto on the date
hereof.  From time to time subsequent to the date hereof, additional
Subsidiaries of the Borrower may become Additional Grantors, by executing a
Counterpart.  Upon delivery of any such Counterpart to Secured Party,
notice of which is hereby waived by Grantors, each such Additional Grantor shall
be a Grantor and shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Additional Grantor
were an original signatory hereto.  Each Grantor expressly agrees that
its obligations arising hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the
addition or release of any other Grantor hereunder, nor by any election of
Secured Party not to cause any Subsidiary of the Borrower to become an
Additional Grantor hereunder.  This Agreement shall be fully effective
as to any Grantor that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any
other Person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Grantor
hereunder.

 

SECTION
      21.

Amendments;
      Etc.

 

    
No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor therefrom, shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Secured
Party and, in the case of any such amendment or modification, by Grantors; provided this
Agreement may be modified by the execution of a Counterpart by an Additional
Grantor in accordance with Section 20 hereof and
Grantors hereby waive any requirement of notice of or consent to any such
amendment.  Any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given.

      22.

Notices.

 

    
Any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall
be in writing and shall be personally delivered, transmitted by postage prepaid
registered or certified mail or by overnight mail, or transmitted by telephonic
facsimile ("FAX") and electronic mail ("EMAIL") to the parties.  For
