Variable Rate Senior Notes due December 31, 2010


December 31, 2009


To each of the Purchasers Listed in


             Schedule A Hereto:


Ladies and Gentlemen:


     PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES, a Delaware corporation (the Company), agrees with each of the
purchasers whose name appears at the end hereof (each, a Purchaser and, collectively, the
Purchasers) as follows:










Section 1.
 
Authorization of Notes.




     Section 1.1. Description of Notes. The Company will authorize the issue and sale of
$120,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Variable Rate Senior Notes due December 31, 2010
(the Notes, such term to include any such notes issued in substitution therefor (including Global
Notes) pursuant to Section 13). The Notes
shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit A-1 or A-2, as applicable. Certain
capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; and references to a
Schedule or an Exhibit are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to
this Agreement.


     Section 1.2. Interest Rate. The Notes shall bear interest (computed on the basis of actual
days elapsed and a 360-day year) (a) on the unpaid balance thereof at the rate per annum equal to
the Interest Rate from the date thereof, payable on the last day of March, June, September and
December in each year (each, an Interest Payment Date) and at maturity, commencing on March 31,
2010 until the principal thereof shall have become due and payable, and (b) to the extent permitted
by law, on any overdue payment (including any overdue prepayment) of principal and on any overdue
payment of interest, at a rate per annum from time to time equal to 2% over the rate of interest
set forth in clause (a), payable quarterly on each Interest Payment Date, as aforesaid (or at the
option of the registered holder thereof, on demand). Interest payable on each Interest Payment
Date will be paid to the holders of the Notes as of the immediately preceding Record Date. Record
Date means, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, the tenth Business Day prior to such
Interest Payment Date.










Section 2.
 
Sale and Purchase of Notes.




     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to
Piper Jaffray & Co. as Initial Purchaser Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $120,000,000
at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, and Initial Purchaser will sell to
each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the Initial Purchaser, at the Closing provided
for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount specified opposite such Purchasers name in
Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. The Purchasers
obligations hereunder are several and not joint obligations and no Purchaser shall have any
liability to any Person for the performance or non-performance of any obligation by any other
Purchaser hereunder.










Section 3.
 
Closing.




     The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by each Purchaser shall occur at the
offices of Faegre & Benson LLP, 90 South 7th Street, Suite 2200, Minneapolis, Minnesota
55402, at 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis time, at a closing (the Closing) on December 31, 2009. At the
Closing, the Initial Purchaser will deliver to each Purchaser through the DTC book-entry system
pursuant to Section 13.4 (in denominations of at least $500,000 as such Purchaser may request)
beneficial interests in the Notes, which shall be evidenced by a Global Note dated the date of the
Closing and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, against delivery by such
Purchaser to the Initial Purchaser or its order of immediately available funds in the amount of the
purchase price therefor by same day settlement process through DTC. If at the Closing the Initial
Purchaser shall fail to tender such Notes to any Purchaser as provided above in this Section 3, or
any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to such Purchasers
satisfaction, such Purchaser shall, at its election, be relieved of all further
obligations under this Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights such Purchaser may have
by reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.










Section 4.
 
Conditions to Closing.




     Such Purchasers obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be sold to such Purchaser at
the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to such Purchasers satisfaction, prior to or at the
Closing, of the following conditions:

Company in this Agreement shall be correct when made and at the time of the Closing.


     Section 4.2. Performance; No Default. The Company shall have performed and complied with all
agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement required to be performed or complied with by
it prior to or at the Closing and after giving effect to the issue and sale of the Notes (and the
application of the proceeds thereof as contemplated by Section 5.14) no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall have entered
into any transaction since December 18, 2009 that would have been prohibited by Sections 10.1
through 10.4 had such Sections applied since such date.


     Section 4.3. Compliance Certificates.


     (a) Officers Certificate. The Company shall have delivered to such Purchaser an Officers
Certificate, dated the date of the Closing, certifying that the conditions specified in Sections
4.1, 4.2 and 4.8 have been fulfilled.


     (b) Secretarys Certificate. The Company shall have delivered to such Purchaser a certificate
of its Secretary or Assistant Secretary, dated the date of Closing, certifying as to the
resolutions attached thereto and other corporate proceedings relating to the authorization,
execution and delivery of the Notes and this Agreement.


     Section 4.4. Opinion of Counsel. Such Purchaser shall have received opinions in form and
substance satisfactory to such Purchaser, dated the date of the Closing from Faegre & Benson LLP,
counsel for the Company, covering the matters set forth in Exhibit 4.4(a) and covering such other
matters incident to the transactions contemplated hereby as such Purchaser or its counsel may
reasonably request (and the Company hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such opinion to the
Purchasers).


     Section 4.5. Purchase Permitted By Applicable Law, Etc. On the date of the Closing such
Purchasers purchase of Notes shall (a) be permitted by the laws and regulations of each
jurisdiction to which such Purchaser is subject, (b) not violate any applicable law or regulation
(including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System) and (c) not subject such Purchaser to any tax, penalty or liability under or
pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. If requested by such Purchaser, such Purchaser shall
have received an Officers Certificate certifying as to such matters of fact as such Purchaser may
reasonably specify to enable such Purchaser to determine whether such purchase is so permitted.


     Section 4.6. Sale of Other Notes. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the Initial Purchaser
shall sell to each other Purchaser and each other Purchaser shall purchase the Notes to be
purchased by it at the Closing as specified in Schedule A.


     Section 4.7. Payment of Special Counsel Fees. Without limiting the provisions of Section
15.1, the Company shall have paid on or before the Closing the fees, charges and disbursements of
the Purchasers special counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP, to the extent reflected in a statement of
such counsel rendered to the Company at least one Business Day prior to the Closing.


     Section 4.8. Private Placement Number. A Private Placement Number issued by Standard & Poors
CUSIP Service Bureau (in cooperation with the SVO) shall have been obtained for the Notes.


     Section 4.9. Changes in Corporate Structure. The Company shall not have changed its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as applicable, or been a party to any merger or
consolidation or succeeded to all or any substantial part of the liabilities of any other entity,
at any time following the date of the most recent financial statements referred to in Schedule 5.5.


     Section 4.10. Proceedings and Documents. All corporate and other proceedings in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all documents and instruments incident to
such transactions shall be satisfactory to such Purchaser and its special counsel, and such
Purchaser and its special counsel shall have received all such counterpart originals or certified
or other copies of such documents as such Purchaser or such special counsel may reasonably request.










Section 5.
 
Representations and Warranties of the Company.




     The Company represents and warrants to each Purchaser that:


     Section 5.1. Organization; Power and Authority. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it
transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Notes and to
perform the provisions hereof and thereof.


     Section 5.2. Authorization, Etc. This Agreement and the Notes have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon
execution and delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights


generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).


     Section 5.3. Disclosure. This Agreement and the documents, certificates or other writings
delivered to the Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and identified in Schedule 5.3, and the financial statements listed in Schedule
5.5 (this Agreement and such documents, certificates or other writings and such financial
statements delivered to each Purchaser prior to the date hereof being referred to, collectively, as
the Disclosure Documents), taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Disclosure
Documents, since December 31, 2008, there has been no change in the financial condition,
operations, business, properties or prospects of the Company or any Subsidiary except changes that
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. There is no fact known to the Company that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the Disclosure Documents.


     Section 5.4. Organization and Ownership of Shares of Subsidiaries; Affiliates. (a) Schedule
5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and correct lists (i) of the Companys
Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its
organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or similar equity
interests outstanding owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary, (ii) of the Companys
Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries, and (iii) of the Companys directors and senior officers.


     (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of each
Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary
free and clear of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).


     (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or other legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those
jurisdictions as to
which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the
corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own
or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.


     (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal, regulatory, contractual or
other restriction (other than this Agreement, the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary
limitations imposed by corporate law or similar statutes) restricting the ability of such
Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar
equity interests of such Subsidiary.


     Section 5.5. Financial Statements; Material Liabilities. The Company has delivered to each
Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule
5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case the related schedules and notes)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in
the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments). The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any Material liabilities that are not
disclosed on such financial statements or otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure Documents.


     Section 5.6. Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, Etc. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Notes will not (i) contravene, result in any
breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any
property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan,
purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate charter or by-laws, or any other agreement or
instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or by which the Company or any
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (ii) conflict with or
result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or
ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary or (iii) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.


     Section 5.7. Governmental Authorizations, Etc. No consent, approval or authorization of, or
registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with
the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes, except for
the filing with the SEC of a Current Report on Form 8-K and a Form D.


     Section 5.8. Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and Orders. (a) Except
as identified under Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of the Companys Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and updated in subsequent reports filed with the SEC,
there are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the
Company or any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Authority that, if determined adversely to the Company or any Subsidiary, individually
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


     (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term of any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling
of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law,
ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation Environmental Laws or the USA Patriot
Act) of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.


     Section 5.9. Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that are
required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and
payable on such returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their properties,
assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable
and before they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (i) the amount of
which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (ii) the amount, applicability or
validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with
respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has established adequate reserves
in accordance with GAAP. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on
the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes for all
fiscal periods are adequate. The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been finally determined (whether by reason of completed audits or the statute of
limitations having run) for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31,
2005.


     Section 5.10. Title to Property; Leases. The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
sufficient title to their respective properties that individually or in the aggregate are Material,
including all such properties reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in
Section 5.5 or purported to have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date
(except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in each case free and
clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that individually or in the aggregate are
Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.


     Section 5.11. Licenses, Permits, Etc. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries own or possess all
licenses, permits, franchises, authorizations, patents, copyrights, proprietary software, service
marks, trademarks and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are
Material, without known conflict with the rights of others.


     (b) To the best knowledge of the Company, no product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes in any material respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent, copyright,
proprietary software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by any other Person.


     (c) To the best knowledge of the Company, there is no Material violation by any Person of any
right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, proprietary
software, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.


     Section 5.12. Compliance with ERISA. (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated
and administered each Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of
noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to
Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the
Code relating to any Plan, and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could
reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any


ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights, properties or assets of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such
penalty or excise tax provisions or to section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code or section 4068 of
ERISA, other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate
Material.


     (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each of the Plans (other than
Multiemployer Plans), determined as of the end of such Plans most recently ended plan year on the
basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Plans most recent
actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate current value of the assets of such Plan
allocable to such benefit liabilities. The term benefit liabilities has the meaning specified in
section 4001 of ERISA and the terms current value and present value have the meaning specified
in section 3 of ERISA.


     (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal liabilities (and are not
subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.


     (d) The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of the last day of the
Companys most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 106, without regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by
section 4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.


     (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes
hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of
ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of
the Code. The representation by the Company to each Purchaser in the first sentence of this
Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of such Purchasers
representation in Section 6.2 as to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the
Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser.


     Section 5.13. Private Offering by the Company. Neither the Company nor anyone acting on its
behalf (including the Initial Purchaser) has offered the Notes or any similar securities for sale
to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in
respect thereof with, any person other than the Purchasers. Neither the Company nor anyone acting
on its behalf (including the Initial Purchaser) has taken, or will take, any action that would
subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act or to the registration requirements of any securities or blue sky laws of any
applicable jurisdiction.


     Section 5.14. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. The Company will apply the proceeds of the
sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchaser to fund, in part, the acquisition of the capital stock
of Advisory Research, Inc. If such acquisition is not consummated, the Company may use the
proceeds of the sale of the Notes for other corporate purposes of the Company. No
part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for
the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the


Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying
or trading in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of
Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of
Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). As used in this Section, the terms margin stock and
purpose of buying or carrying shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.


     Section 5.15. Existing Indebtedness; Future Liens . (a) Except as described
therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Consolidated
Funded Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (including a
description of the obligors and obligees, principal amount outstanding and collateral therefor, if
any, and Guaranty thereof, if any), since which date there has been no Material change in the
amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Indebtedness of
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default and no
waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any
Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or the lapse
of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and
payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.


     (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any
provision contained in, any instrument evidencing Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary,
any agreement relating thereto or any other agreement (including, but not limited to, its charter
or other organizational document) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on
the incurring of, Indebtedness of the Company, except as specifically indicated in Schedule 5.15.


     Section 5.16. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc. (a) Neither the sale of the Notes by
the Company hereunder nor its use of the proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy
Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury
Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive
order relating thereto.


     (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is a Person described or designated in the
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of Foreign Assets Control or
in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or (ii) engages in any dealings or transactions with any
such Person. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material respects, with
the USA Patriot Act.


     (c) No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly or
indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or employee, political party, official of
a political party, candidate for political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity,
in order to obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of the
United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, assuming in all cases that such
Act applies to the Company.


     Section 5.17. Status under Certain Statutes. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended, the ICC Termination Act of 1995, as amended, or the
Federal Power Act, as amended.


     Section 5.18. Environmental Matters. (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge
of any claim or has received any notice of any claim, and no proceeding has been instituted raising
any claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective real properties
now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any damage to
the environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


     (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of any facts which would give rise to
any claim, public or private, of violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment
emanating from, occurring on or in any way related to real properties now or formerly owned, leased
or operated by any of them or to other assets or their use, except, in each case, such as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


     (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has stored any Hazardous Materials on real
properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them and has not disposed of any
Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner that
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and


     (d) All buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or operated by the Company or any
Subsidiary are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply
could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


     Section 5.19 Other Securities. Within the preceding six months, neither the Company nor any
other person acting on behalf of the Company (including the Initial Purchaser) has offered or sold
to any person any Notes, or any securities of the same or a similar class as the Notes, other than
the Notes offered or sold to the Purchasers hereunder. The Company will take reasonable

Section 6. Representations of the Purchasers.


     Section 6.1. Purchase for Investment. Each Purchaser severally represents that it is
purchasing the Notes for its own account and not with a view to the distribution thereof in
violation of the Securities Act, it being recognized that the Initial Purchaser is selling the
Notes hereunder solely to Qualified Institutional Buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated by the
SEC under the Securities Act, as amended from time to time (Rule 144A). Each Purchaser
understands that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may be resold only
if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act or if an exemption from registration
is available, except under circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is
required by law, and that the Company is not required to register the Notes. Each Purchaser
represents that it is a Qualified Institutional Buyer acting for its own account (and not for the
account of others) or as a fiduciary or agent for others (which others are also Qualified
Institutional Buyers) and is aware that the sale of the Notes to such Purchaser will be made in
reliance on Rule 144A. Each Purchaser further represents that such Purchaser has had the
opportunity to ask questions of the Company and received answers concerning the terms and
conditions of the sale of the Notes.


Each Purchaser agrees that it will only offer, sell or otherwise transfer the Notes (a) to the
Company or the Initial Purchaser, or by, through or in a transaction approved by, the Initial
Purchaser, or (b) as long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a Person
it reasonably believes is a Qualified Institutional Buyer under Rule 144A that purchases for its
own account or for the account of a Qualified Institutional Buyer to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A. Each Purchaser acknowledges that the Company and
the Initial Purchaser will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of the acknowledgements,
representations or agreements are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Company and the
Initial Purchaser; and if any Purchaser is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or
more Persons who qualifies as Qualified Institutional Buyers, such Purchaser


represents that it has
sole investment discretion with respect to each such Person and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such Person. Each
Purchaser acknowledges that (i) the Initial Purchaser, Piper Jaffray & Co., is a subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) its registered representative at Piper Jaffray & Co. in connection with this purchase
is an employee of Piper Jaffray & Co., (iii) Piper Jaffray & Co. may compensate such Purchasers
registered representative by reference to the dollar amount of the Notes such Purchaser is
purchasing from the Initial Purchaser and (iv) it is aware that the relationships referred to above
pose a potential conflict of interest.


     Section 6.2. Source of Funds. No Purchaser is an employee benefit plan or an entity whose
underlying assets are deemed to include plan assets by reason of the investment by an employee
benefit plan in the entity within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3101.


As used in this Section 6.2, the term employee benefit plan shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in section 3 of ERISA.

(i) of Section 11(g)) has occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become
immediately due and payable.


          (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of
more than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or
their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be
immediately due and payable.

every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived.


     Section 12.2. Other Remedies. If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately due
and payable under Section 12.1, the

the rights of such holder or Beneficial Holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other
appropriate proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or
in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.


     Section 12.3. Rescission. At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable
pursuant to Section 12.1(b) or (c), the holders of not less than 51% in principal amount of the

declaration and its consequences if (a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all

any Note upon any holder or Beneficial Holder thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power
or remedy referred to herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute

Section 13. Registration; Exchange; Substitution of Notes.

form, the Company shall keep at its principal executive office a register for the registration and
registration of transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each
transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be
registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person in
whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof
for all purposes hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the
contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct
copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.


     Section 13.2. Transfer and Exchange of Notes. If Notes are taken out of the DTC book-entry
system and issued in definitive form, upon surrender of any Note to the Company at the address and
to the attention of the designated officer (all as specified in Section 18(iii)), for registration
of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer accompanied by
a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or such
holders attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the relevant name,


address and
other information for notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), within ten Business
Days thereafter, the Company shall execute and deliver, at the Companys expense (except as
provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor,
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note.
Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1. Each such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from
the date to which interest shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the
surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such
transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than $500,000, provided
that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of its entire holding of
Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $500,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance
of a Note registered in its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the
representations set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.


          (b) The Company shall deliver a single permanent global Note in registered form,
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A-2 (the Global Notes), registered in the name of
Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC, duly executed by the Company. The Company will require that all
resales be made in compliance with the provisions of Rule 144A to Qualified Institutional Buyers
who have advised the Company in writing that they are purchasing the Note for their own account or
accounts with respect to which such Qualified Institutional Buyer exercises sole investment
discretion and that such Qualified Institutional Buyer is aware that the sale to it is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A and acknowledges that it has received such information regarding the
Company as it has requested pursuant to Rule 144A or has determined not to request such information
and that it is aware that Piper Jaffray & Co. is relying upon its foregoing representations in
order to claim the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A. Any such transferee shall be
deemed to have also made the representations set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.


          (c) If a beneficial interest in the Global Notes is proposed to be transferred, the
transfer of such beneficial interest may be effected only through the book-entry system maintained
by DTC.


          (d) The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities laws
of any state and may not be transferred or resold unless registered under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such requirement
is available. Upon the registration of transfer, exchange or replacement of Notes, the Company
shall deliver only Notes that bear a legend to such effect.


     Section 13.3. Replacement of Notes. If Notes are taken out of the book-entry system of DTC
and issued in definitive form, upon receipt by the Company at the address and to the attention of
the designated officer (all as specified in Section 18(iii)) of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
it of the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence
shall be notice from such holder of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation), and


     (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to
it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser
or another holder of a Note with a minimum net worth of at least $100,000,000 or a Qualified
Institutional Buyer, such Persons own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to
be satisfactory), or


     (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation thereof,


within ten Business Days thereafter, the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in
lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have
been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.


     Section 13.4. Book-Entry Provisions for Global Notes. (a) The Notes issued to the Purchasers
hereunder shall be in the form of a Global Note which initially shall be registered in the name of
Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC. The ownership interests of each beneficial holder (a Beneficial
Holder) of a Global Note will be recorded on DTCs records and are expected to receive written
confirmations from DTC of their transaction from the direct or indirect participants in DTC (Agent
Members). Agent Members shall have no rights under this Agreement with respect to any Global
Notes held on their behalf by DTC, or under any Global Note, and DTC may be treated by the Company
and any agent of the Company as the absolute owner of each Global Note for all purposes whatsoever;
provided, that each Beneficial Holder shall have the rights expressly granted to Beneficial Holders
hereunder, subject to written notice to the Company from such Beneficial Holder confirming its
status as a Beneficial Holder and disclosing the principal amount of its beneficial interest in the
Global Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company or any agent
of the Company from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by DTC or impair, as between DTC and its Agent Members, the operation of customary
practices governing the exercise of the rights of a Beneficial Holder of any Note.


          (b) Transfers of Global Notes shall be limited to transfers in whole, but not in part, to DTC,
its successors or nominees. Interests of Beneficial Holders in any Global Note may be transferred
or exchanged for physical Notes in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC and the
provisions of Section 13.2.


          (c) In connection with any transfer or exchange of a portion of the beneficial interest in
any Global Notes to Beneficial Holders pursuant to clause (b) above, DTC shall reflect on its books
and record the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the beneficial interest in such
Global Note to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, one or more Notes of like tenor and
amount.


          (d) In connection with the transfer of interests of Beneficial Holders in Global Notes for
physical Notes pursuant to clause (b) above, the Global Notes shall be deemed to be surrendered to
the Company for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, to each such Beneficial Holder
identified by DTC in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Notes, an equal aggregate
principal amount of physical Notes of authorized denominations.


          (e) All transfers and exchanges of Global Notes or beneficial interests therein shall be
effected through DTC, in accordance with this Agreement (including applicable restrictions on
transfer set forth herein) and the procedures of DTC. A transferor of a beneficial interest in a
Global Note shall deliver a written order given in accordance with DTCs procedures containing
information regarding the participant account of DTC to be credited with a beneficial interest in
such Global Note and such account shall be credited in accordance with such order with a beneficial
interest in the Global Note and the account of the person making the transfer shall be debited by
an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the Global Note being transferred. Any transferee of
a beneficial interest in a Global Note shall be deemed to have made the representations set forth
in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.


          (f) The holder of a Global Note may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person,
including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any
action which a holder of a Note is entitled to take under this Agreement.


Section 14. Payments on Notes.


     Section 14.1. Place of Payment. Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal and interest
becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in Chicago, Illinois at the corporate trust
office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as paying agent for further payment to
DTC and DTC shall make payments to its direct participants for credit to the beneficial owners
through DTCs typical payment procedures.


     Section 14.2. Home Office Payment. If Notes are taken out of the book-entry system of DTC and
issued in definitive form, then so long as any Purchaser or its nominee shall be the holder of the
Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the
Company will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal and interest by the method and at
the address specified for such purpose below such Purchasers name in Schedule A, or by such other
method or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have from time to time specified to the
Company in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of such Note or the
making of any notation thereon, except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently
with or reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such Purchaser shall
surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such request, to the Company at
its principal executive office or at the place of payment most recently designated by the Company
pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by a Purchaser
or its nominee, such Purchaser will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount of
principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender such
Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Company will
afford the benefits of this Section 14.2 to any Person that is the direct or indirect transferee of
any Note purchased by a Purchaser under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement
relating to such Note as the Purchasers have made in this Section 14.2.


Section 15. Expenses, Etc.


     Section 15.1. Transaction Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Company will pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees of a
special counsel and, if reasonably required by the Required Holders, local or other counsel)

such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of
this Agreement or the Notes (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective),

any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including financial advisors fees, incurred in
connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with
any work-out or restructuring of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The
Company will pay, and will save each Purchaser and each other holder and Beneficial Holder of a
Note harmless from, all claims in respect of any fees, costs or expenses, if any, of brokers and
finders (other than those, if any, retained by a Purchaser or other holder or Beneficial Holder in
connection with its purchase of the Notes).


     Section 15.2. Survival. The obligations of the Company under this Section 15 will survive the
payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or the Notes, and the termination of this Agreement.


Section 16. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire Agreement.


     All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer by any Purchaser of any Note or portion
thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent
holder or Beneficial Holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on
behalf of such Purchaser or any other holder or Beneficial Holder of a Note. All statements
contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties of the
Company under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes
embody the entire agreement and understanding between each Purchaser and the Company and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.


Section 17. Amendment and Waiver. 


     Section 17.1. Requirements. This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance
of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and
only with) the written consent of the Company and the Required Holders, except that no such
amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time
outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration
or rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or


payment of principal of, or reduce
the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of interest on the Notes, (ii)
change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or
20.


     Section 17.2. Solicitation of Holders of Notes.


          (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the
amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the
date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with
respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof or
of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment,
waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of
outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives
the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.


          (b) Payment. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any
remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any
security or provide other credit support, to any holder or Beneficial Holder of Notes as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder or Beneficial Holder of
Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration
is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted or other credit support concurrently
provided, on the same terms, ratably to each holder or Beneficial Holder of Notes then outstanding
even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.


     Section 17.3. Binding Effect, etc. Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this
Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each future
holder of any Note and upon the Company without regard to whether such Note has been marked to
indicate such amendment or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any
obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or
impair any right
consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder or Beneficial Holder
of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a
waiver of any rights of any holder or Beneficial Holder of such Note. As used herein, the term
this Agreement and references thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be
amended or supplemented.


     Section 17.4. Notes Held by Company, etc. Solely for the purpose of determining whether the
holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding

Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be taken upon
the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
then outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall
be deemed not to be outstanding.

consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be executed, (b) documents received by any
Purchaser at the Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates
and other information previously or hereafter furnished to any Purchaser, may be

notice shall be signed by both such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliates
