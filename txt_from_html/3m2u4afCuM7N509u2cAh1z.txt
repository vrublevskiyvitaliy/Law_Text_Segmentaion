The Director Plan covers all non-employee directors of the

comprised of an annual stock option grant.

 

On January 5th of
each year, each non-employee director is entitled to receive an annual award of
stock options to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock.  The stock options are awarded under the Company’s 2008 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “2008
Plan”), and subject to the terms of such plan.  The stock
options shall have a term of ten (10) years and shall vest in full on the first
anniversary of the date of grant.

 

Directors elected after January 1st of
any given fiscal year, shall receive an option award pro-rated for each full or
partial month remaining during the year in which the director is
elected.  For instance, a director first elected on June 15th,
shall receive an award at a ratio of 7/12ths to the full award, or 116,667
shares.
