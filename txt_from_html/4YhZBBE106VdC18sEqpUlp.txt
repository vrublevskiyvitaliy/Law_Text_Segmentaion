1. Purpose of Plan


The Willis Group Holdings 2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan, as amended and restated on December 30, 2009 by
Willis Group Holdings Limited and as amended and restated and assumed by Willis Group Holdings Public Limited

Subsidiaries (collectively, Willis Group) by attracting and retaining personnel with the
training, experience and ability to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the
success of Willis Groups business;


(b) to motivate management personnel by means of growth-related incentives to achieve long
range goals; and


(c) to further the identity of interests of participants with those of the shareholders of
Willis through opportunities for increased share, or share-based, ownership in Willis.

transaction, including to substitute or provide for the issuance of ordinary shares of the

3. Administration of Plan


(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. All of the members of the Committee and
any other Directors shall be eligible to be selected for Grants under the Plan; provided,
however, that to the extent the Board of Directors determines it is necessary or desirable
to satisfy any regulation or rule, whether under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 of the United States, as amended (Exchange Act) or otherwise related to the
Grants, the members of the Committee shall qualify under such regulation or rules. The
Committee may adopt its own rules of procedure, and the action of a majority of the
Committee, taken at a meeting or taken without a meeting by a writing signed by such
majority, shall constitute action by the Committee. The Committee shall have the power and
authority to administer, construe and interpret the Plan in its sole discretion, to make
rules for carrying it out and to make changes in such rules. The Committee shall also have
the power to establish sub-plans, which may constitute separate schemes, for the purpose of
establishing schemes which qualify for approval by the UK Inland Revenue or meet any special
tax or regulatory requirements anywhere in the world. Any such interpretations, rules,
administration and sub-plans shall be consistent with the basic purposes of the Plan and
shall be binding on Participants.


(b) The Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer and to other senior officers
of Willis Group its duties under the Plan subject to such conditions and limitations as the
Committee shall prescribe except that only the Committee may designate and make Grants,
including the variation (including substitution), cancellation or suspension of said Grant,
to Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.


(c) The Committee may employ attorneys, consultants, accountants, appraisers, brokers or
other persons. The Committee, Willis Group, and the officers and Directors of Willis Group
shall be entitled to rely upon the advice, opinions or valuations of any such persons. All
actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith
shall be final and binding upon all Participants, Willis Group and all other interested
persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination
or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or the Grants, and all members
of the Committee shall be fully protected by Willis Group with respect to any such action,
determination or interpretation.


(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan or any Grant Agreement,
(i) neither Willis, the Willis Group, any Designated Associate Company or any of their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents or representatives nor any member of the
Committee shall have liability to a Participant or otherwise with respect to the failure of
the Plan, any Grant or Grant Agreement to comply with Section 409A of the Code and (ii)
neither Willis, the Willis Group, any Designated Associate Company or any of their
respective employees, directors, officers, agents or representatives nor any member of the
Committee makes any representation or warranty to any Participant that any Grant hereunder
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.


4. Eligibility


Subject to Section 12 of the Plan, the Committee may from time to time make Grants under the Plan
to such Employees of the Willis Group or of any Designated Associate Company, and in such form and
having such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine. Grants may be granted
singly, in combination or in tandem. The terms, conditions and limitations of each Grant under the
plan shall be set forth in a Grant Agreement, in a form approved by the Committee, consistent,
however, with the terms of the Plan.


5. Share Limitations and Conditions


(a) Number of SharesSubject to adjustment as provided in Section 9, a total of
8,000,000 Shares shall be authorized for grant under the Plan. The Shares available for the
grant of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan shall not exceed 5,000,000 Shares, subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 9 and subject to the provisions of Sections 422 or 424
of the Code or any successor provisions. The Shares available for the grant of Restricted
Share, Restricted Share Units or other full-value share-based grants under the Plan shall
not exceed 2,000,000.


If any Shares subject to a Grant are forfeited, terminate, expire or a Grant is settled for
cash (in whole or in part) or otherwise does not result in the issuance of all or a portion
of the Shares subject to such Grant, the Shares subject to such Grant or award shall, to the
extent of such forfeiture, expiration, termination, non-issuance, cash settlement or
otherwise, again be available for Grants under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the following Shares shall not be added to the Shares authorized
for grant under paragraph (a) of this Section: (i) Shares tendered by the Participant or
withheld by the Company in payment of the purchase price of a Share Option; (ii) Shares
tendered by the Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding
obligation with respect to a Grant; and (iii) Shares repurchased by the Company using Option
proceeds.


(b) Substitute Awards shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan or
authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year. Additionally, in the event that
a company acquired by Willis or any Subsidiary or with which the Willis or any Subsidiary
combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not
adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant
pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate,
using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such
acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of Ordinary
Shares of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Grants
under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant under the Plan; provided
that Grants using such available shares shall not be made after the date grants could have
been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination,
and shall only be made to individuals who were not Employees or Directors prior to such
acquisition or combination.


(c) Purchase Shares, as defined in Section 6 (c) below whether offered to a participant or
in connection with any other Grant under this Plan, shall not be counted against the above
limits if they are sold to a Participant at Fair Market Value on the date of purchase.


(d) The number of Shares subject to Grants under this Plan to any one Participant shall not
be more than 2,000,000 Shares in any one calendar year and such limit shall not include
Purchase Shares.


(e) No Grants shall be made under the Plan beyond ten years after the original effective
date of the Plan, but the terms of Grants made on or before the expiration of the Plan may
extend beyond such expiration. At the time a Grant is made or amended or the terms or
conditions of a Grant are changed, the Committee may provide for limitations or conditions
on such Grant.


(f) Nothing contained herein shall affect the right of Willis Group or, if applicable, a
Designated Associate Company to terminate any Participants employment at any time or for
any reason. The rights and obligations of any individual under the terms of his office or
employment with any member of Willis


Group or, if applicable, a Designated Associate Company shall not be affected by his or her
participation in this Plan or any right which he or she may have to participate in it, and
an individual who participates in this Plan shall waive any and all rights to compensation
or damages in consequence of the termination of his or her office or employment for any
reason whatsoever insofar as those rights arise or may arise from his or her ceasing to have
rights under or be entitled to exercise any Grant as a result of such termination.


(g) Subject to complying with Section 409A of the Code, deferrals of Grant payouts may be
provided for, at the sole discretion of the Committee, in the Grant Agreements.


(h) Except as otherwise prescribed by the Committee, the amounts of the Grants for any
employee of a Subsidiary, along with interest, dividend, and other expenses accrued on
deferred Grants shall be charged to the Participants employer during the period for which
the Grant is made. If the Participant is employed by more than one Subsidiary or by both the
Company and a Subsidiary during the period for which the Grant is made, the Participants
Grant and related expenses will be allocated between the companies employing the Participant
in a manner prescribed by the Committee.


(i) No option, right or benefit under the Plan may be transferred by a Participant other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and except as set forth in paragraph
(k) of this Section, all options, rights and benefits under the Plan may be exercised during
the Participants lifetime only by the Participant. No such benefit shall, prior to receipt
thereof by the Participant, be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, contracts,
liabilities, engagements, or torts of the Participant.


(j) Participants shall not be, and shall not have any of the rights or privileges of,
shareholders of Willis in respect of any Shares purchasable in connection with any Grant
unless and such Shares have been issued by Willis to such Participants, unless the
Committee shall otherwise determine.


(k) No election as to benefits or exercise of Share Options or other rights may be made
during a Participants lifetime by anyone other than the Participant or by a legal
representative appointed for or by the Participant.


(l) Absent express provisions to the contrary, any Grant under this Plan shall not be deemed
compensation for purposes of computing benefits or contributions under any retirement plan
of any member of Willis Group and shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan
of any kind now or subsequently in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits
is related to level of compensation. This Plan is not a Pension Plan or Welfare Plan
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 of the United States, as amended.


(m) Unless the Board of Directors determines otherwise, no benefit or promise under the Plan
shall be secured by any specific assets of any member of Willis Group, nor shall any assets
of any member of Willis Group be designated as attributable or allocated to the satisfaction
of Willis Groups obligations under the Plan.


6. Grants


From time to time, the Committee will determine the forms and amounts of Grants for Participants.
Such Grants may take the following forms in the Committees sole discretion; provided, however,
that in no event shall the purchase price of any Grant be less than the par value of the Shares.
The terms of any Grant may include a requirement that the Participant enter into an agreement or
election under which the Participant agrees to pay his or her employers social security liability
(or reimburse the employer for such liability) in any jurisdiction arising on exercise of any Share
Option, or at any other time with respect to any other Share-Based Award, and if this requirement
is not permitted in any jurisdiction the Grant in such circumstances shall be null and void.


(a) Share OptionsThese are options to purchase Ordinary Shares, which may or may not be
Incentive Stock Options. The option price per each Share purchasable under any Share Option
granted pursuant to this Article shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one
Share on the date of


grant of such option (or, if the person to whom the Incentive Stock Option is being granted
owns Ordinary Shares representing more than 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of
Willis equity, the exercise price shall be at least equal to 110% of the Fair Market Value
of one Ordinary Share on the date of grant) other than in connection with Substitute Awards.
At the time of the Grant the Committee shall determine, and shall have contained in the
Grant Agreement the option exercise period, the option price, and such other conditions or
restrictions on the grant or exercise of the option as the Committee deems appropriate,
which may include the requirement that the grant of options is predicated on the acquisition
of Purchase Shares under Section 6(c) by the Participant or as may be required pursuant to
applicable law, if such options shall be Incentive Stock Options, subject to Section 12.
Payment of the option price shall be made in cash or in Ordinary Shares (provided, that such
Shares have been held by the Participant for not less than six months (or such other period
as established by the Committee from time to time)), or a combination thereof, in accordance
with the terms of the Plan, the Grant Agreement and any applicable guidelines of the
Committee in effect at the time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan,
Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of Willis or of a parent
corporation or subsidiary corporation (as such terms are defined in Section 424 of the
Code) at the date of grant. The aggregate Fair Market Value (generally determined as of the
time the Share Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock
Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under
all plans of Willis and of any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation as defined in
Section 424 of the Code) shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). For
purposes of the preceding sentence, Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account
generally in the order in which they are granted. No Incentive Stock Option may be exercised
later than ten (10) years after the date it is granted or five years, in the case of a
Participant who owns Ordinary Shares representing more than 10 percent of the voting power
of all classes of Willis equity. Each provision of the Plan and each Grant Agreement
relating to an Incentive Stock Option shall be construed so that each Incentive Stock Option
shall be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code, and any provisions
of the Grant Agreement thereof that cannot be so construed shall be disregarded. Except for
Substitute Awards and in certain limited situations, including, without limitation the
death, disability, termination of employment of the Participant without good cause as
determined by the Committee, or retirement of the Participant or a Change of Control, Share
Options shall have a vesting period of not less than three (3) years from date of grant (but
permitting pro rata vesting over such time) provided that such restrictions shall not be
applicable to grants of Share Options, Restricted Share Awards or Restricted Share Unit
Awards not in excess of 5% of the number of shares available for Grants under Section 5(a).
Share Options subject to the achievement of performance objectives shall have a minimum
vesting period of one (1) year.


(b) Restricted Share and Restricted Share UnitsGrants of Restricted Share and of
Restricted Share Units may be issued to Participants either alone or in addition to other
Grants made under the Plan (a Restricted Share Award or Restricted Share Unit Award
respectively). Except for Substitute Awards and in certain limited situations, including,
without limitation the death, disability, termination of employment of the Participant
without good cause as determined by the Committee, or retirement of the Participant, a
Change of Control, Restricted Share Awards and Restricted Share Unit Awards subject to
continued service with the Company or a Subsidiary shall have a vesting period of not less
than three (3) years from date of grant (but permitting pro rata vesting over such time);
provided that such restrictions shall not be applicable to grants of Share Options,
Restricted Share Awards or Restricted Share Unit Awards not in excess of 5% of the number of
shares available for Grants under Section 5(a). Restricted Share Awards and Restricted Share
Unit Awards subject to the achievement of performance objectives shall have a minimum
vesting period of one (1) year.


Unless otherwise provided in the Grant Agreement, beginning on the date of grant of the
Restricted Share Award and subject to execution of the Grant Agreement, the Participant
shall become a shareholder of Willis with respect to all Shares subject to the Grant
Agreement and shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote
such Shares and the right to receive distributions made with respect to such Shares. A
Participant receiving a Restricted Share Unit Award shall not possess the rights of a
shareholder of Willis with respect to such grant. Except as otherwise provided in an Grant
Agreement any Shares or any other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend or
otherwise with respect to any Restricted Share Award or Restricted Share Unit Award as to
which the restrictions have not yet lapsed shall be subject to the same restrictions as such
Restricted Share Award or Restricted Share Unit Award.


Should Shares be issued upon vesting of Restricted Share Award or Restricted Share Unit
Awards in circumstances where they are not otherwise fully paid up, the Board may require
the Participant to pay the aggregate nominal value of the Shares on the basis that such
Shares underlying the Restricted Share Award or Restricted Share Unit Award shall then be
allotted as fully paid to the Participant.


(c) Purchase SharesPurchase Shares refer to Ordinary Shares held in Willis employee share
ownership plan trust, The Trinity Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust, offered to a
Participant at not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of
purchase, the acquisition of which may make him eligible to receive under the Plan, among
other things, Share Options.


(d) Other Share-Based GrantsThe Committee may make other Grants under the Plan pursuant to
which Ordinary Shares or other equity securities of Willis are or may in the future be
acquired, or Grants denominated in Share units, including ones valued using measures other
than Fair Market Value. Other Share-Based Grants may be granted with or without
consideration. Should Ordinary Shares be issued on the vesting of a Share-Based Grant in
circumstances where they are not otherwise fully paid up, the Board may require the
Participant to pay the aggregate nominal value of such Ordinary Shares on the basis that
such Ordinary Shares shall then be allotted as fully paid to the Participant.


(e) Entitlement to Dividend EquivalentsSubject to complying with Section 409A of the Code
and the provisions of the Plan, including, without limitation Section 14, and any Grant
Agreement, the recipient of a Grant other than a Share Option may, if so determined by the
Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, Share or other
property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to cash, Share or other property
dividends on Shares (Dividend Equivalents) with respect to the number of Shares covered by
the Grant, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. The right of US
Participants to receive Dividend Equivalents or other dividends or payments shall be treated
as a separate Grant and such Dividend Equivalents or other dividends or payments for such US
Participants, if any, shall be credited to a notional account maintained by Willis or paid,
as of the dividend payment dates during the period between the date of the Grant and the
date the Grant is exercised, vested, expired, credited or paid, as applicable and shall be
subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may provide
that such amounts and Dividend Equivalents (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested
in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested and may provide that such amounts and Dividend
Equivalents are subject to the same vesting or performance conditions as the underlying
Grant.


(f) Performance AwardsIf the Committee determines that a Share Option, Restricted Share
Award, a Restricted Share Unit Award, a Performance Award or an Other Share-Based Award is
intended to be subject to performance goals, the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the
distribution of cash, Shares or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall be
subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the
Committee, which shall be based on the attainment of specified levels of one or any
combination of the following: net revenue; revenue growth or product revenue growth;
operating income (before or after taxes); pre- or after-tax income (before or after
allocation of corporate overhead and bonus); earnings per share; net income (before or after
taxes); return on equity; total shareholder return; return on assets or net assets;
appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Shares or any other publicly-traded
securities of Willis; market share; gross profits; earnings (including earnings before
taxes, earnings before interest and taxes or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization); economic value-added models or equivalent metrics; comparisons with
various Share market indices; reductions in costs; cash flow or cash flow per share (before
or after dividends); return on capital (including return on total capital or return on
invested capital); cash flow return on investment; improvement in or attainment of expense
levels or working capital levels; operating margins, gross margins or cash margin; year-end
cash; debt reductions; Shareholder equity; market share; regulatory achievements; and
implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to research,
development, products or projects, production volume levels, acquisitions and divestitures
and recruiting and maintaining personnel. Such performance goals also may be based solely by
reference to Willis performance or the performance of a Subsidiary, division, business
segment or business unit of Willis, or based upon the relative performance of other
companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other
companies. The Committee may also exclude charges related to an event or


occurrence which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (a)
restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or
non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of Willis
or not within the reasonable control of Willis management, or (c) the cumulative effects of
tax or accounting changes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by,
and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, and the
regulations thereunder.


7. Forfeiture or Clawback of Awards


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Grant Agreement may provide that the
Grant shall be canceled if the Participant, without the consent of Willis, while employed by
Willis, any Subsidiary or, if applicable, a Designated Associate Company or after termination of
such employment or service, establishes a relationship with a competitor of Willis, any Subsidiary
or, if applicable, a Designated Associate Company or engages in activity that is in conflict with
or adverse to the interest of Willis, any Subsidiary or, if applicable, a Designated Associate
Company (including conduct contributing to financial restatements or irregularities), as determined
by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. The Committee may provide in a Grant Agreement
that if within the time period specified in the Grant Agreement the Participant establishes a
relationship with a competitor or engages in an activity referred to in the preceding sentence, the
Participant will forfeit any gain realized on the vesting or exercise of the Grant and must repay
such gain to Willis.


8. Transfers and Leaves of Absence


For purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise: (a) a transfer of a
Participants employment without an intervening period of separation among a member of the Willis
Group and any Subsidiary or Designated Associate Company shall not be deemed a termination of
employment, and (b) a Participant who is granted in writing a leave of absence shall be deemed to
have remained in the employ of Willis Group or Designated Associate Company during such leave of
absence.


9. Adjustments


In the event of any change in the outstanding Ordinary Shares by reason of a Share split, spin-off,
Share or extraordinary cash dividend, Share combination or reclassification, recapitalization or
merger, Change of Control, or similar event, the Committee shall substitute or adjust
proportionately, in its sole discretion, (a) the number and kind of Shares or other securities that
may be issued under the Plan or under particular forms of Grants, (b) the number and kind of Shares
or other securities subject to outstanding Grants, (c) the Share Option exercise price, grant price
or purchase price applicable to outstanding Grants, (d) the grant of a Dividend Equivalent or other
dividends or payments, and/or (e) other value determinations applicable to the Plan or outstanding
Grants, in all events in order to allow Participants to participate to such event in an equitable
manner. An adjustment under this provision may have the effect of reducing the price at which
Ordinary Shares may be acquired to less than their nominal value (the Shortfall), but only if and
to the extent that the Board shall be authorized to capitalize from the reserves of the Company a
sum equal to the Shortfall and to apply that sum in paying up that amount on the Ordinary
Shares.


10. Change of Control


(a) Grant Agreements may provide that in the event of a Change of Control of Willis, Share
Options outstanding as of the date of the Change of Control shall be cancelled and
terminated without payment therefore if 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the
date of the Change of Control is less than the per Share Option exercise price grant price.


(b) Assumption or Substitution of Certain AwardsUnless otherwise provided in a Grant
Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control of Willis in which the successor company
assumes or substitutes for a Share Option, Restricted Share Award, Restricted Share Unit
Award or Other Share-Based Grant, if a Participants employment with such successor company
(or a subsidiary thereof) terminates within 24 months following such Change of Control (or
such other period set forth in the Grant Agreement,


including prior thereto if applicable) and under the circumstances specified in the Grant Agreement:
(i) Share Options outstanding as of the date of such termination of employment will
immediately vest, become fully exercisable, and may thereafter be exercised for 24 months
(or the period of time set forth in the Grant Agreement), (ii) restrictions and deferral
limitations on Restricted Share Awards and Restricted Share Units Awards shall lapse and the
Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units shall become free of all restrictions and
limitations and become fully vested, and (iii) the restrictions and deferral limitations and
other conditions applicable to any Other Share-Based Grants or any other Grants shall lapse,
and such Other Share-Based Grants or such other Grants shall become free of all
restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full
extent of the original Grant. For the purposes of this Section 10(b), a Share Option,
Restricted Share Award, Restricted Share Unit Award or Other Share-Based Grants shall be
considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change of Control the Grant confers
the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Share Option, Restricted
Share Award, Restricted Share Unit Award or Other Share-Based Grants immediately prior to
the Change of Control, the consideration (whether Shares, cash or other securities or
property) received in the transaction constituting a Change of Control by holders of Shares
for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a
choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the
transaction constituting a Change of Control is not solely ordinary shares of the successor
company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the
consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of a Share Option, Restricted
Share Award, Restricted Share Unit Award or Other Share-Based Grant, for each Share subject
thereto, will be solely ordinary shares of the successor company substantially equal in Fair
Market Value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction
constituting a Change in Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of
consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination
shall be conclusive and binding.


(c) Unless otherwise provided in a Grant Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control of
Willis to the extent the successor company does not assume or substitute for a Share Option,
Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award or Other Share-Based Grant: (i) those
Share Options outstanding as of the date of the Change of Control that are not assumed or
substituted for shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable, (ii) restrictions and
deferral limitations on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that are not assumed or
substituted for shall lapse and the Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall become
free of all restrictions and limitations and become fully vested, and (iii) the restrictions
and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Share-Based Grants or
any other Grants that are not assumed or substituted for shall lapse, and such Other
Share-Based Grants or such other Grants shall become free of all restrictions, limitations
or conditions and become fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the original
grant.


(d) The Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control of Willis, each Share Option outstanding shall terminate within a specified number
of days after notice to the Participant, and/or that each Participant shall receive, with
respect to each Share subject to such Share Option an amount equal to the excess of the Fair
Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control
over the exercise price per share of such Share Option; such amount to be payable in cash,
in one or more kinds of Shares or property (including the Shares or property, if any,
payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its
discretion, shall determine.


11. Amendment and Termination


The Committee shall have the authority to make such amendments to any terms and conditions
applicable to outstanding Grants as are consistent with this Plan. The Board of Directors may
amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time.


Without the approval of Willis Shareholders, other than pursuant to Section 9, the Committee shall
not (i) increase the benefits accrued to Participants, (ii) increase the number of shares which may
be issued under the Plan, (iii) cancel any Share Option in exchange for cash or another Grant
(other than in connection with Substitute


Awards) (iv) modify the requirements for participation in the Plan, (v) lapse or waive restrictions except
in limited cases relating to death, disability, retirement, termination of employment without
cause or for good reason as is determined by the Board, or Change of Control.


12. Foreign Options and Rights


The Committee or Board of Directors, as applicable, may establish rules or schemes in order to make
Grants to Employees who are subject to the laws of nations other than Ireland, which Grants may
have terms and conditions that differ from the terms thereof as provided elsewhere in the Plan for
the purpose of complying with foreign laws. In the event that the Committee or Board of Directors
establishes such rules or schemes, the substantive provisions thereof shall be set forth on
schedules attached hereto, and are hereby incorporated by reference as part of the Plan, subject to
any additional action required to be taken pursuant to the applicable foreign law.


13. Withholding Taxes


(a) Willis Group shall have the right to deduct from any cash payment made under the Plan
any federal, state, local, national, provincial or other income or other taxes required by
law to be withheld with respect to such payment. It shall be a condition to the obligation
of Willis Group to deliver shares upon the exercise of a Share Option, upon delivery of
Restricted Share or upon exercise, settlement or payment of Restricted Share Units or any
Other Share-Based Grant that the Participant shall pay to Willis Group such amount as may be
requested by Willis Group for the purpose of satisfying any liability for such withholding
taxes. Any Grant Agreement may provide that the Participant may elect, in accordance with
any conditions set forth in such Grant Agreement, to pay a portion or the entire minimum
amount of such withholding taxes in Ordinary Shares.


(b) In the event that Willis Group is required to account for tax arising from the exercise
or vesting of a Grant to the relevant tax authorities and the Participant has not paid, or
otherwise made arrangements acceptable to Willis Group to pay the amounts due, Willis Group
shall be authorized to procure and effect the sale of a sufficient number of Shares to be
allotted or transferred to the Participant as a consequence of the vesting or exercise of
the Grant in order to pay the amounts due out of the sale proceeds.


(c) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 13, an option may not be exercised
unless:


(i) the Board of Directors considers that the issue or transfer of shares pursuant
to such exercise would be lawful in all relevant jurisdictions; and


(ii) in a case where, if the option were exercised, Willis Group would be obliged to
(or would suffer a disadvantage if it were not to) account for any tax (in any
jurisdiction) for which the person in question would be liable by virtue of the
exercise of the option and/or for any social security contributions that would be
recoverable from the person in question (together, the Tax Liability), that person
has either:


(d) made a payment to Willis Group of an amount at least equal to the Companys estimate of
the Tax Liability; or


(e) entered into arrangements acceptable to Willis Group to secure that such a payment is
made (whether by authorizing the sale of some or all of the shares on his behalf and the
payment to Willis Group of the relevant amount out of the proceeds of sale or otherwise).


14. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code


(a) To the extent that the Plan and/or Grants are subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion and without a Participants prior consent, amend the
Plan and/or Grants, adopt policies and procedures, or take any other actions (including
amendments, policies, procedures and actions with retroactive effect) as are necessary or
appropriate to (a) exempt the Plan and/or any Grant from the


application of Section 409A of the Code, (b) preserve the intended tax treatment of any such
Grant, and/or (c) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. This Plan shall
be interpreted at all times in such a manner that the terms and provisions of the Plan and
Grants are exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code. Reference to Section 409A of
the Code includes reference to any proposed, temporary or final regulations and any other
guidance promulgated with respect to such section by the U.S. Department of the Treasury of
the Internal Revenue Service.


(b) All Grants that would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be paid or
otherwise settled on or as soon as practicable after the applicable vesting date and not
later than the 15th day of the third month from the end of (i) the Participants tax year
that includes the applicable vesting date, or (ii) Willis tax year that includes the
applicable vesting date, whichever is later; provided, however, that the Committee reserves
the right to delay payment or specify a compliant payment date with respect to any such
Grant under circumstances set forth in Section 409A of the Code; provided, further, that
notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or a Grant Agreement, any payment(s) that
are otherwise required to be made under the Plan to a specified employee (as defined under
Section 409A of the Code) as a result of his or her separation from service (other than a
payment that is not subject to Section 409A of the Code) shall be delayed for the first six
(6) months following such separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the
specified employee) and shall instead be paid (in a manner set forth in the Grant Agreement)
on the date that immediately follows the end of such six-month period or as soon as
administratively practicable thereafter.


15. Governing Law


This Plan shall be governed by the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflicts of laws.


16. Effective Date and Termination Dates


The Plan became effective on and as of the date of the original approval of the Willis Group
Holdings 2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan by a majority of the shareholders of Willis,
and shall terminate ten years thereafter, subject to earlier termination by the Board of Directors
pursuant to Section 11.
