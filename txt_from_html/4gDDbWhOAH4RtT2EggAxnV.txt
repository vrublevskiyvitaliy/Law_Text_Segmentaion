As
hereinafter set forth, Reseller, on behalf of its employees, officers,
directors, agents, contractors, shareholders, clients, customers, and members,
understands and agrees to perform the following duties and accepts the
responsibilities as herein identified:

 

 
      

(A)

Submit
      marketing/sales verbiage for approval electronically in Microsoft Word and
      all marketing materials in their final approved format electronically as a
      PDF file or mutually agreed upon
format. 

 
      

(B)

Obtain
      prior written approval from NB for any and all printed literature,
      radio/television media, telemarketing scripts, press releases, web sites,
      enrollment materials, membership cards, or similar items as to their
      content, design, format, use of any trade names, use of any Vendor name,
      trademark, or service mark of NB or any Vendor under contract with
      NB.  Reseller shall use only the exact marketing, enrollment,
      and fulfillment verbiage approved by NB when describing or making
      reference to the discount health benefits listed in Schedule
      1.  Failure to obtain written approval from NB concerning any
      materials (printed, electronic or of any other kind or type whatsoever)
      referencing the benefits set forth on Schedule 1 will result in NB, in its
      sole discretion, having the right to immediately terminate this
      Agreement.  Such termination will result in Reseller’s members
      being ineligible to use the Membership Services.  In addition,
      Reseller must secure written approval from NB for all reprints when any
      changes have been made. Further, on the first (1st)
      day of June each year, Reseller must submit to NB all current marketing,
      solicitation, enrollment, and fulfillment materials (printed, electronic

      along with an executed copy of Exhibit
B.

 
      

(C)

Submit
      to NB any and all telephone numbers used for inbound and/or outbound
      telemarketing of NB’s Program and/or any web site address(es), prior to
      launch, containing benefit descriptions and/or Vendor information for any
      NB product or service.  NB reserves the right at its sole
      discretion to monitor any and all such telephone numbers and web sites for
      the purpose of ensuring compliance as related to NB’s
    Program.

 
      

(D)

Pay
      NB compensation as set forth in Schedule 1 for each membership under the
      following terms and conditions:

(1)

Said
      compensation shall be paid by the fifteenth (15th)
      day of each month for all active members enrolled by the last day of the
      previous month. If Reseller fails to pay NB within ten (10) days of
      receipt of billing, NB may notify Reseller in writing of such failure to
      pay and issue a warning to Reseller that if payment in full for all
      previously billed amounts is not received within five (5) days from date
      of notice, the Agreement may be terminated at the sole discretion of
      NB.  NB may consider the failure to make payment a breach of
      Reseller’s obligations under this Agreement and then may elect, without
      notice, to cease providing Reseller’s members access to the NB Membership
      Services pending receipt of payment.  Termination of this
      Agreement does not relieve Reseller of the obligation to pay all monies
      due.

 
      

(2)

If
      Reseller believes there is an error on any billing or commission statement
      received from NB or Reseller requires additional information regarding a
      specific transaction, Reseller should submit a written request for
      information within ninety (90) days of the statement date to the address
      specified on the statement.  Any inquiry regarding an alleged
      error not submitted to NB within ninety (90) days will be considered
      waived by Reseller.  Any correspondence should include
      Reseller’s name, account number, and a full description of the error
      and/or the transaction in question.

 

 
      

(E)

Work
      within the parameters of the Program as set forth by NB and/or NB’s
      Vendors.  It is Reseller’s responsibility to obtain the
      appropriate training information from NB for each applicable benefit
      included in the Program.  Reseller is authorized to recruit
      independent sales representatives and/or entities (hereinafter referred to
      as “ISR”) to market the Program on behalf of Reseller.  Reseller
      is responsible for thoroughly training each ISR in respect to the benefits
      and services purchased from NB. Reseller is responsible for ensuring each
      ISR represents all NB benefits accurately and in conformity with NB’s
      existing practices, procedures and requirements by requiring each ISR to
      execute Exhibit A.  Further, Reseller agrees to indemnify,
      defend and hold NB harmless from any and all loss, claims, demands,
      damages, suits, liabilities and any costs or expenses, including
      reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from or in any way connected with (i)
      the failure of the ISR to perform its duties in conformity with NB’s
      existing practices, procedures and requirements or (ii) any
      misrepresentation made by ISR which is false, misleading or containing any
      material misstatement of fact or omitting any material fact required to be
      stated to make the statements therein not
      misleading.  Additionally, NB retains the right to refuse any
      opportunity brought to NB by
Reseller.

 
      

(F)

Send
      to NB all new member information electronically or hardcopy in a mutually
      agreed upon format within ten (10) days of receipt by
      Reseller.  Reseller agrees to use best efforts to ensure all
      data supplied to NB for processing is in good condition, correct,
      complete, and in proper format as set forth by NB. NB agrees all such
      member information is considered the confidential property of Reseller and
      as such, said information shall not be utilized by NB for any reason other
      than the furtherance of this Agreement without the express written consent
      of Reseller.

 
      

(G)

Be
      responsible for all costs and expenses associated with Reseller’s
      responsibilities under this Agreement, including marketing
      materials.

 
      

(H)

Forfeit,
      along with NB, the membership fees to provide a refund to members
      commensurate with the prevailing law in the state the membership is
      sold.

Authorize
      NB to reference Reseller as a
client.

 
      

(J)

      that its purchases hereunder from NB are sold to customers on a
      non-exclusive basis.

(K)

Submit
      a completed Group Information Form to NB for each new group setup in NB’s
      system a minimum of three (3) weeks prior to the group’s initial
      enrollment date.  After thirty (30) days from the execution of
      this Agreement, all new Group Information Forms must be accompanied by a
      nonrefundable administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
      each.

 
      

(L)

Provide
      NB the name of any client, along with the name of their program if it is
      private-labeled, to whom Reseller resells NB’s products and
      services.  Reseller shall not wholesale benefits to any other
      person or entity without NB’s prior written
  consent.

 
      

(M)

Agree
      to link Reseller’s web sites, or any affiliated web sites created for the
      purpose of marketing NB products and services, exclusively to the links
      provided by NB in order for benefit descriptions and Vendor information to
      remain up to date.

 
      

(N)

Secure
      and maintain all licenses, registrations and permits by any local, state,
      federal, or governmental authority required of Reseller in the performance
      of its obligations under this Agreement.  Reseller shall notify

      governmental instrumentality involving
Reseller.

 
      

(O)

      not to resell by multilevel marketing NB benefits without prior written
      agreement from NB.

 
      

(P)

      NB’s approval on the retail pricing for any benefit package including one
      or more of NB’s benefits.  Reseller agrees to list each benefit
      package along with the corresponding retail pricing in a Price Filing
      Form.  Should Reseller offer any benefit package which includes
      NB’s benefits without obtaining NB’s prior written approval in a Price
      Filing Form or a subsequent Addendum, NB will consider such action a
      breach of Reseller’s obligations under this Agreement and may result in
      NB, in its sole discretion, terminating this
  Agreement.

 
      

(Q)

Reseller
      cannot sell multiple year memberships without prior written consent from
      NB.

 
      

(R)

Pay
      NB a one-time setup fee of $2,500.00 via check upon execution of this
      Agreement.  Should Reseller enroll a minimum of twenty-five
      hundred (2,500) active members within the first twelve (12) months
      following the execution of this Agreement, Reseller may submit a Request
      for Credit Form to NB and NB will then credit the $2,500.00 setup fee back
      to Reseller.  Should Reseller fail to enroll a minimum of
      twenty-five hundred (2,500) members by the one-year anniversary date of
      this Agreement, NB will permanently retain the initial setup fee in its
      entirety.  The aforementioned $2,500.00 fee includes setup of
      Reseller’s groups in NB’s system during the initial thirty (30) days
      following the execution of this Agreement.  After thirty (30)
      days from the execution of this Agreement, Reseller agrees to pay NB a
      nonrefundable administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per
      group.  Once Reseller’s total enrollment reaches a minimum of
      twenty-five hundred (2,500) active members, NB agrees to waive the fifty
      dollar ($50.00) administrative fee for any additional
    groups.



4.  NATURE
OF RELATIONSHIP

 

No terms
or provisions of this Agreement are intended to create nor shall they be deemed
or construed to create any relationship between NB and Reseller other than that
of independent entities contracting with each other hereunder solely for the
purpose of effecting the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  The
parties hereto are not and shall not be deemed for any purpose to be joint
ventures, partners, or agents of each other.  Neither of the parties
hereto, nor any of their respective officers, directors, or employees, shall
represent themselves as the partner, employee, servant, or agent of the other

terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions contained in this
Agreement.  This Agreement shall automatically renew on the same terms
and conditions for successive one-year periods, unless terminated in writing, by

below.  This Agreement may be terminated at any time as
follows:

 

 
      

(A)

with
      thirty (30) days notice by either party without cause. In the event this

      upon in writing by both parties.

      seven (7) days notice by NB with cause for misrepresentation by Reseller
      and/or Reseller’s ISR of the Program in the marketplace. In the event this
      Agreement is terminated by NB with cause, existing business may continue
      to be serviced at the sole discretion of NB as long as membership fees are

      non-breaching party may give written notice demanding said default be
      remedied within thirty days, and if the default is not remedied, this
      Agreement is deemed terminated with no further action. In addition to any
      other rights and/or remedies available at law, in equity or under contract

      addition, the party responsible for breaching this Agreement agrees to pay
      all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by both parties in
      obtaining specific performance of, or any equitable relief against
      violation of, or continuous violation of, the requirements of this
      Agreement. In the event this Agreement is terminated with cause, existing
      business may continue to be serviced at the sole discretion of NB as long

notwithstanding
      the foregoing, immediately by NB if Reseller is found to have any
      unauthorized memberships (memberships that have not been enrolled with NB
      and/or have not been paid for by Reseller).  Unauthorized
      memberships shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by Reseller and
      shall be cause for immediate termination of this Agreement and/or
      deactivation of Reseller’s enrolled members. Termination of this Agreement
      does not relieve Reseller of the obligation to pay all monies
      due.

 
      

(E)

notwithstanding
      the foregoing,  immediately by NB if Reseller, its affiliates,
      related entities, and/or subsidiaries, or any agent acting on behalf of
      Reseller, is found to be engaged directly or indirectly in any unethical
      and/or illegal marketing practices, including but not limited to any form
      of fax blasting.  Unethical and/or illegal marketing practices
      shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by Reseller and shall be cause

      Reseller’s enrolled members. Termination of this Agreement does not
      relieve Reseller of the obligation to pay all monies
  due.

notwithstanding
      the foregoing, immediately if any state, local or federal law or
      regulation is enacted or promulgated that prohibits the performance of any
      of the duties hereunder, or if any law is interpreted to prohibit such
      performance.



7.  CONFIDENTIALITY

quotes, proposed commission structures, and policies (including listing thereof
and documentation related thereto) disclosed by either party hereto to the
other, its employees, officers, directors, agents, or representatives, during
the term of this Agreement.  The parties acknowledge and agree the

      treat Confidential Information in confidence and use it only in connection
      with this Agreement;

 
      

(B)

      obtaining the prior written consent of the disclosing
    party;

 
      

(C)

not
      to disclose Confidential Information except that such information may be
      disclosed to the receiving party’s directors, officers, and employees to
      the extent necessary for purposes directly related to the performances of
      receiving party’s duties under this
Agreement;

 
      

(D)

to
      return Confidential Information, including all copies and records thereof,

      obligations after expiration of the
Agreement;

(G)

to
      keep strictly confidential the terms and conditions of this

      pricing described in any schedules or exhibits at NB’s sole
      discretion.



If the
receiving party or anyone to whom it discloses the Confidential Information
becomes legally compelled to disclose all or any part of the Confidential
Information (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or other order issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or by a government agency), the receiving party shall (i)
promptly, and prior to compliance with the request, notify the disclosing party
of the existence, terms, and circumstances comprising such a request; (ii)
consult with the disclosing party on the advisability of taking steps to resist
or narrow that request, and to the extent legally permissible, delay such
disclosure until the disclosing party has taken all reasonable steps necessary
to resist or narrow that request; (iii) if disclosure of the Confidential
Information is required, after notifying the disclosing party, furnish only such
portion of the Confidential Information as the receiving party is advised by
counsel is legally required to be disclosed; and (iv) cooperate with the
disclosing party, at the disclosing party’s expense, in its efforts to obtain a
protective or limiting order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be afforded to that portion of the Confidential Information that
is required to be disclosed.

Agreement without cause), it and they shall not directly or indirectly contract
with any Vendors listed in Schedule 1 of this Agreement, nor shall they hire any
employee of NB during this time period, nor shall they utilize NB’s confidential
provider lists to solicit and/or contract with any providers in the event
Reseller elects to establish its own vision, chiropractic, or any other provider
network made available to Reseller by NB under the terms of this
Agreement.  Reseller is not prohibited from establishing its own
provider network(s) when soliciting providers from lists in the public domain or
from establishing a business relationship with another party that maintains a
provider network which includes one or more of the providers in NB’s provider
network.



The
covenants by Reseller contained in this paragraph are of the essence of this
Agreement and NB would not sell the Program hereunder to Reseller in the absence
of such covenants. In consideration of such covenants and to entrust to Reseller
provider lists, marketing materials, and other related Confidential Information
pertaining to the business of NB, Reseller hereby expressly agrees the
utilization of such training and sales information in competition against NB or
its affiliates as hereinafter expressly prohibited would be grossly unfair to NB
and would cause continuing irreparable damage to NB.

9.  NON-CIRCUMVENTION

 

Any
direct sales leads or referrals developed, created or furnished by Reseller in
the promotion and/or marketing of memberships in any of NB benefit program which
result in sales of, or negotiations for sales of memberships, shall be
considered a potential client of Reseller.  In order to prevent
Reseller’s potential clients from trying to contract directly with NB, Reseller
must complete NB’s Non-Circumvention Agreement.  Upon receipt of each
completed Non-Circumvention Agreement, NB will notify Reseller if the client
listed has been registered as Reseller’s prospect.  Should the named
organization or one of their representatives try to contact NB, NB will
immediately direct them back to Reseller.  NB’s Non-Circumvention
Agreement is valid for a period of ninety (90) days. In the event Reseller and
Reseller’s potential client do not enter into a written Agreement within ninety
(90) days from the date NB accepts the Non-Circumvention Agreement, said
Non-Circumvention Agreement shall be terminated.  Reseller may prevent
termination by presentation of a “Broker of Record” letter from their respective
client.  In the absence of a properly executed and valid
Non-Circumvention Agreement, NB will have no obligations to Reseller under this
paragraph and will be free to deal with such leads, references, and/or clients
as NB deems appropriate.



From time
to time, more than one reseller may try to secure the same client’s business at
the same time.  The Non-Circumvention Agreement does not preclude
other resellers of NB’s Program from working with a prospective client listed in
the Non-Circumvention Agreement.  However, it does prevent the client
from going directly to NB for the purpose of negotiating a
contract.  In the event two entities have presented NB’s benefits to
the same client or their representative, the client will be asked to issue a
“Broker of Record” statement designating which reseller has been
selected.



10.  INDEMNIFICATION

 

NB
agrees, except as otherwise provided, to indemnify, defend and hold Reseller
harmless from any and all loss, claims, demands, damages, suits, liabilities and
any costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or in
any way connected with (i) the failure of NB to provide the Program in
accordance with its terms; or (ii) the failure of NB to perform its duties
pursuant to this Agreement and/or observe all of the terms, covenants and
conditions contained herein; or (iii) any representation by NB which is false,
misleading or containing any material misstatement of fact or omitting any
material fact required to be stated to make the statements therein not
misleading.



Reseller
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold NB harmless from any and all loss, claims,
demands, damages, suits, liabilities and any costs or expenses, including
reasonable attorney’s fees, arising from or in any way connected with (i) the
sale or furnishing of services of Reseller;  (ii) the failure of
Reseller to perform its duties under this Agreement and/or observe all of the
terms, covenants and conditions contained herein; or (iii) any representation
made by Reseller which is false, misleading or containing any material
misstatement of fact or omitting any material fact required to be stated to make
the statements therein not misleading.



11.  PARTIAL
INVALIDITY: SEVERABILITY

 

In case
any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any
reason, be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed, so far as is
reasonable and possible, as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
or provisions had never been contained herein or in a manner that is reasonable

      savings to a member on a prescription, the pharmacy benefit processor will
      not pay a marketing fee to NB, thus no marketing fee will be paid to
      Reseller.) Provided monthly utilization payment exceeds $100.00, Reseller
      will receive marketing fees 100 days from the first day of the month
      following utilization. For example, utilization fees incurred from
      February 1st-28th
      will be paid to Reseller no later than June 10th;
      fees incurred from March 1st-31st
      will be paid no later than July 10th.
      Termination of this Agreement by NB for breach of contract may result in
      permanent forfeiture of all marketing
fees.

FREE
PHARMACY CARD PROGRAM

Reseller
is authorized to market a Free Pharmacy Card Program. As there is no per member
per month fee for the pharmacy benefit, Reseller is prohibited from charging the
member a monthly fee to access this Program. Further, NB agrees to pay Reseller
a marketing fee of $0.50 for each pharmacy utilization paid by the pharmacy
benefit processor to NB. In the event there is no savings to a member on a
prescription, the pharmacy benefit manager will not pay a marketing fee to NB,
thus no marketing fee will be paid to Reseller. Provided monthly utilization
payment exceeds $100.00, Reseller will receive marketing fees 100 days from the
first day of the month following utilization. For example, utilization fees
incurred from February 1st-28th will
be paid to Reseller no later than June 10th;
fees incurred from March 1st-31st will
be paid no later than July 10th.
Termination of this Agreement by NB for breach of contract may result in
permanent forfeiture of all marketing fees.



Reseller
