ARTICLE II
PUT RIGHTS


     2.1. Put Right Grants and Mechanics.


              (a) HSI hereby grants to Oak Hill the right (a Put Right), at any time and from time
to time on or after the earlier of (x) first anniversary of the Closing Date or (y) an HSI Change
of Control, to require HSI to purchase all or any portion of the Securities then owned by Oak Hill,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.


              (b) Oak Hill may exercise its Put Right by delivery of a written Notice (a Put
Notice) to HSI, which Put Notice shall state that Oak Hill is exercising its Put Right to
require HSI to purchase the number and type of Securities specified in such Put Notice (the
Put Securities).


          2.2. Determination of Fair Market Value. For purposes of calculating Put Price
payable in connection with the exercise of any Put Right, the Fair Market Value shall be determined
as follows:


              (a) Pre-QPO. If the Put Notice is delivered prior to a Qualified Initial Public
Offering, the Put Price payable in connection with the exercise of any Put Right shall be
determined as follows:


     (i) Mutual Agreement. Oak Hill and HSI shall use all reasonable
efforts and negotiate in good faith to agree upon the Fair Market Value. If Oak
Hill and HSI agree upon the Fair Market Value, then, subject to the conditions to
closing set forth in Section 2.4 below, Oak Hill shall sell, transfer and
convey, and HSI shall purchase and accept, the Put Securities free and clear of all
Liens at the Put Closing for the Put Price calculated based on such agreed-upon Fair
Market Value.


     (ii) Dispute Procedures. (1) If Oak Hill and HSI are unable to agree
upon the Fair Market Value pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(i) within twenty-one
(21) days of the Put Notice Date, then either party may request, by delivery of a
written Notice to the other party, a reputable independent nationally
recognized investment bank retained by the Company, or, if such investment bank is not acceptable to Oak Hill or HSI, another
reputable independent nationally recognized investment bank as to which HSI and Oak
Hill mutually agree (the Designated Investment Banker), that the
Designated Investment Banker determine the Fair Market Value. If HSI and Oak Hill
are unable to agree upon the selection of the Designated Investment Banker, then
each shall select one nationally recognized investment bank and the Designated
Investment Banker shall be selected by those two investment banks, whose
determination of the Designated Investment Banker will constitute an arbitral award
that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered
by a court with jurisdiction thereover. The Designated Investment Banker shall
determine the Fair Market Value, using such method or methods of determining Fair
Market Value as it, in its sole discretion, shall determine; provided,
however, that in determining Fair Market Value, the Designated Investment
Banker shall (A) not include a discount for lack of control, minority interests,
lack of a public market in the Companys securities or leverage levels, block sale
discounts or otherwise take into account any contractual restrictions on the
Companys ability to operate anywhere in the world or limiting HSIs ability to
consummate the Put Closing (other than as set forth in this Agreement), (B)
consider, among other things, the value that could be realized by a sophisticated
seller seeking to maximize the consideration to be received for the Put Securities,
whether through a private sale of 100% of the Company or a strategic combination or
in an Initial Public Offering (determined on a fully distributed basis) and
assuming, for purposes of the valuation, that the capital stock of the Company is
widely held and no one shareholder holds a control position), without taking into
consideration any initial public offering discount or underwriters discount or any
other costs or expenses of sale, and (C) consider, in addition to any other methods
deemed by the Designated Investment Banker, in its sole discretion, to be customary
or appropriate, the Enterprise Value Methodology. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Designated Investment Banker shall not consider or attribute any value (or negative
value) to any distribution advances by the Company provided for in Section
6.6(a)(ii) of the Operating Agreement or tax liabilities relating to the change from
the LIFO to the FIFO inventory accounting method, which is the subject of the last
sentence of Section 4.1 of the Operating Agreement. Upon reasonable notice, the
Designated Investment Banker shall provide each of Oak Hill and HSI the opportunity
to make one presentation (with representatives of the non-presenting party present)
of reasonable length to the Designated Investment Banker regarding their respective
views on the determination of Fair Market Value; provided that any materials
provided by any party to the Designated Investment Banker in connection with such
presentation shall be simultaneously provided to the other party. The Designated
Investment Banker shall issue its determination in writing to Oak Hill and HSI (the
Final Determination) within forty-five (45) days of


delivery of the initial Notice to the Designated Investment Banker requesting
such determination and will constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and
non-appealable and upon which judgment may be entered by a court with jurisdiction
thereover.


     (2) Oak Hill shall have fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Final
Determination (the Decision Period) to decide whether to (A) withdraw its
Put Notice or (B) require HSI to purchase the Put Securities indicated in its Put
Notice for a price equal to the Put Price calculated based on the Fair Market Value
set forth in the Final Determination, which decision shall be furnished to HSI by
written Notice delivered prior to the expiration of the Decision Period, notifying
HSI of such decision (the Final Notice). If the Final Notice indicates
that Oak Hill is withdrawing its Put Notice or if Oak Hill fails to deliver a Final
Notice prior to the expiration of the Decision Period, then the Put Notice shall be
deemed to be irrevocably withdrawn and HSI shall not be required to purchase the Put
Securities specified in such Put Notice. Any Put Notice that is withdrawn pursuant
to this Section 2.2(a)(ii)(2) shall continue to be deemed to have been
delivered for purposes of Section 2.5(c).


          (b) Post-QPO. If the Put Notice is delivered after a Qualified Initial Public
Offering: (i) if the BAHHC Common Shares are then listed or quoted on NASDAQ or NYSE, the Put Price
shall be equal to the Market Price, and (ii) if the BAHHC Common Shares are not then listed or
quoted on NASDAQ or NYSE, the Fair Market Value shall be determined in accordance with Section
2.2(a). In lieu of exercising a Put Right hereunder, Oak Hill may, subject to any restriction
set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement and any applicable securities law restrictions, sell
any or all of their respective BAHHC Common Shares on the open market pursuant to Rule 144 of the
Securities Act or the Registration Rights Agreement.


     2.3. Payment of Put Price. The Put Price payable by HSI at the Put Closing shall be
payable in a single cash payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Oak Hill in writing at least two (2) days prior to the Put Closing.


     2.4. Put Closing; Conditions Precedent.


          (a) HSI and Oak Hill shall consummate the sale of the Put Shares (the Put Closing)
as soon as reasonably practicable after the delivery of the Final Notice to HSI, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Final Notice (the Put Closing Date),
subject in all respects to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 2.4(b)
and 2.4(c).


          (b) HSIs obligations to purchase the Put Securities at a Put Closing shall be expressly
subject to the fulfillment or express written waiver by HSI of the following conditions on or prior
to the applicable Put Closing Date:


     (i) HSI shall have received from Oak Hill certificates or other instruments
representing the Put Securities, together with unit, stock or other appropriate
powers duly endorsed with respect thereto,  together with and any other documentation
reasonably requested by HSI in order to confirm that such


Put Shares, and all rights in respect thereof (including, without limitation,
all economic and voting rights) are being transferred to HSI free and clear of all
Liens.


     (ii) There shall not be any order of any Governmental Authority restraining or
invalidating the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement.


     (iii) The purchase and sale of the Put Securities at the Put Closing would not
violate the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky laws applicable to
Oak Hill, HSI, the Company or the Put Securities.


          (c) Oak Hills obligations to sell the Put Securities at a Put Closing shall be expressly
subject to the fulfillment or express written waiver by Oak Hill of the following conditions on or
prior to the applicable Put Closing Date:


     (i) HSI shall have paid the Put Price.


     (ii) There shall not be any order of any Governmental Authority restraining or
invalidating the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement.


     (iii) The purchase and sale of the Put Securities at the Put Closing would not
violate the Securities Act or any state securities or blue sky laws applicable to
Oak Hill, HSI, the Company or the Put Securities.


          (d) If any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.4(b) and 2.4(c) are not or are not
reasonably expected to be satisfied on the Put Closing Date, HSI and Oak Hill shall cooperate in
good faith to cause such conditions to be satisfied.


     2.5. Additional Terms and Conditions Applicable to Put Rights.


          (a) Oak Hill shall only be permitted to exercise its Put Right if the Put Price for the Put
Securities to be acquired from Oak Hill at the applicable Put Closing is equal to or greater than
fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), unless the Put Securities constitute all of the Put Securities
then owned by Oak Hill. If, upon determination of the Put Price payable to Oak Hill in connection
with its exercise of a Put Right in accordance with the terms hereof, the Put Price is less than
fifty million dollars ($50,000,000), unless the Put Securities constitute all of the Put Securities
then owned by Oak Hill, then the Put Notice corresponding to such Put Right shall be void ab initio
and HSI shall have no obligation with respect thereto.


          (b) In
any Put Year, HSI shall not be required to pay, in the aggregate, Put
Prices hereunder in excess
of the applicable Annual Put Limitation Amount. If the Put Price otherwise payable by HSI hereunder on a Put
Closing Date, when combined with all other Put Prices paid by HSI hereunder during the Put Year in which such
Put Closing Date is to occur, would exceed the Annual Put Limitation Amount, then, subject to
Section 2.5(a), HSI shall only be obligated to purchase that portion of the Put Securities
that have an aggregate Put Price so that, when combined with all other Put Prices paid by HSI
hereunder during the Put Year in which such Put Closing Date is to occur, the


Annual Put Limitation Amount is not exceeded, and the number of Put Securities to be acquired
on such Put Closing Date shall be reduced accordingly on a pro rata basis.


          (c) No Put Notice may be delivered if a Put Notice has already been delivered during the
immediately preceding twelve (12) month period, and any such Put Notice shall be void ab initio;
provided, however, if a Put Notice is withdrawn pursuant to Sections
2.2(a)(ii)(2) or 2.5(a), then Oak Hill may deliver a Put Notice after the date that is
six (6) months following the (x) expiration of the applicable Decision Period in the case of
Section 2.2(a)(ii)(2) and (y) date of determination that the Put Price is less than
$50,000,000 under Section 2.5.


          (d) The Company shall, and HSI and Oak Hill shall cause the Company to, provide the Designated
Investment Banker with access, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to
management of the Company and to such documents and information as it shall reasonably request,
including, without limitation, the most recently approved Company Budget and projections for the
Companys next fiscal year presented by Company management to the Company Board. Any access under
this Section 2.5(d) shall be subject to such limitations as the Company may reasonably
require to prevent the disclosure of non-public information and/or the material disruption of the
business of the Company, including, without limitation, the execution of a non-disclosure agreement
by the Designated Investment Banker in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
The Company shall provide reasonable prior written notice to HSI and Oak Hill of any access to be
provided by the Company to the Designated Investment Banker. HSI, Oak Hill and their respective
representatives shall have the right to accompany the Designated Investment Banker on any visits to
Companys facilities or in any meetings between the Designated Investment Banker and management of
the Company.


          (e) All fees, costs and expenses of the Designated Investment Banker incurred in connection
with the determination of the Put Price hereunder shall be borne by the Company.


          (f) The Put Rights granted hereunder are personal to Oak Hill and may not be transferred or
assigned by Oak Hill other than in accordance with Section 3.8 hereof.

     3.3. Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement may be modified, amended or waived
only by a writing signed by each of the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Agreement and all
agreements executed pursuant hereto, no course of dealing between or among any of the parties
hereto and no delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any rights hereunder or
thereunder shall operate as a waiver of the rights hereof and thereof.


     3.4. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall attach only to such
provision and shall not in any manner affect or render illegal, invalid or unenforceable any other
provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be carried out as if any such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.


     3.5. Integration. This Agreement, including the exhibits, documents and instruments
referred to herein or therein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof.


     3.6. Construction. The Article and Section headings used or contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction of this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
with counsel sophisticated in investment transactions. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.


     3.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.


     3.8. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; provided, that no party may directly or indirectly assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
HSI and


Oak Hill. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) HSI shall be entitled to assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, without the consent of any other party hereto, to any Affiliate
of HSI; and (b) OHCM and OHCP shall be entitled to assign their respective rights and obligations
under this Agreement, without the consent of any other party hereto, to its Permitted Primary
Transferees; provided, however, that (i) one Person reasonably acceptable to HSI
shall be appointed as agent with full power and authority to act conclusively and timely for and on
behalf of all such Permitted Primary Transferees with respect to their rights and obligations
hereunder, on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to HSI and (ii) HSI shall not incur or
become subject to any additional obligations as a result of any such assignment. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that HSI (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, in each case, the successors
and purchasers of HSI or HSIs properties and assets, as appropriate, shall agree to fulfill and
comply with the obligations set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding any assignment by any
party of its obligations hereunder, such assigning party shall remain primarily liable for all
obligations so assigned.
