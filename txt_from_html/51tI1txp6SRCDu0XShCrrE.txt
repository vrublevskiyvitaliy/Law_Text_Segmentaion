I

SECTION
1.1   Amendment to Section

in its entirety (and inserting in lieu thereof the phrase “[intentionally
omitted]”), as a result of the execution of this Sixth Supplemental
Indenture.

 

SECTION
1.2   Amendment to Section

its entirety and inserting in lieu thereof the phrase “[intentionally
omitted].”

 

SECTION
1.4   Amendment to Section
10.05.  The
provisions of Section 10.05 of the Original Indenture are hereby amended by

MISCELLANEOUS

 

SECTION
2.1   Ratification;
Conflict.  Upon execution and delivery of this Sixth
Supplemental Indenture, the Original Indenture shall be modified and amended in
accordance with this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, and all the terms and
conditions of both shall be read together as though they constitute one
instrument, except that, in case of conflict, the provisions of this Sixth
Supplemental Indenture will control. The Original Indenture, as modified and
amended by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, is hereby ratified and confirmed
in all respects and shall bind every holder of Securities. In case of conflict
between the terms and conditions contained in the Securities and those contained
in the Original Indenture, as modified and amended by this Sixth Supplemental
Indenture, the provisions of the Original Indenture, as modified and amended by
this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, shall control.

 

 


 


 


 


 

SECTION

Indenture Act.  If any provision of this Sixth Supplemental
Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with any provision of the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 (the “TIA”) that is
required under the TIA to be part of and govern any provision of this Sixth
Supplemental Indenture, the provision of the TIA shall control. If any provision
of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the
TIA that may be so modified or excluded, the provision of the TIA shall be
deemed to apply to the Original Indenture as so modified or to be excluded by
this Sixth Supplemental Indenture.

 

SECTION

Terms.  Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in the Original Indenture.

 

SECTION
2.4   Counterparts.  This
Sixth Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

 

SECTION
2.5   Governing
Law.  THIS
SIXTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD

Supplemental Indenture, etc..  Nothing
in this Sixth Supplemental Indenture or the Securities, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and thereto and their
successors hereunder and thereunder and the holders of the Securities, any
benefit of any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under the Original
Indenture, this Sixth Supplemental Indenture or the Securities.

 

SECTION
2.8   Severability.  In
case any provision in this Sixth Supplemental Indenture shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

 

SECTION
2.9   Successors.  All
agreements of the Company in this Sixth Supplemental Indenture shall bind their
respective successors. All agreements of the Trustee in this Sixth Supplemental
